690386,"<p>CHICAGO — The Bring Chicago Home referendum is staying on the ballot — and votes for it will now be counted, a judge said Wednesday.</p>



<p>The decision was released Wednesday by appeals court Judge Raymond Mitchell. It <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/02/23/bring-chicago-home-shouldnt-be-on-march-ballot-judge-rules/"">reverses a lower court&#8217;s February decision</a> on the controversial issue.</p>



<p>The Bring Chicago Home campaign has for years called for the city to increase the tax rate buyers pay on high-end property sales, with the additional funds raised dedicated to providing permanent affordable housing and wraparound services for unhoused Chicagoans.</p>



<p>News of the court&#8217;s decision broke during a Wednesday afternoon press conference held by Mayor Brandon Johnson, police and other leaders about security during the upcoming Democratic National Convention. After pausing to collect his thoughts, Johnson reiterated his commitment to passing Bring Chicago Home.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve said all along the people of Chicago should determine how we address the unhoused crisis in Chicago. And I made a commitment as not just a candidate but as mayor of the city of Chicago that I will do everything in my power to move us closer towards housing for all,&#8221; Johnson said. </p>



<p>&#8220;So I’m encouraging everyone to vote in this upcoming election cycle. And I’m grateful that so many people have worked hard&nbsp;over the course of now the third administration, because this has been a long time coming for the city of Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ballot question asks voters to decide if the city should implement increases in real estate transfer taxes on property sales over $1 million. The City Council <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/11/07/bring-chicago-home-heads-to-chicago-voters-after-council-passage-tuesday/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">voted 32-17 late last year</a> to place the referendum on the March 19 primary ballot.</p>



<p>Real estate groups and landlords have opposed the referendum and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.thedailyline.com/lawsuit-circuit-court-stop-bring-chicago-home-referendum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">sued the elections board to block the question</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/01/12/bring-chicago-home-advocates-say-frivolous-lawsuit-wont-block-ballot-question/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">calling it vague” and “ambiguous”</a>&nbsp;in explaining how it will reduce homelessness. They also argued the referendum improperly grouped three separate questions into one.</p>



<p>Opponents also warned the tax would hurt the Downtown real estate market already struggling to recover from the pandemic.</p>



<p>In late February, Cook County Circuit Judge Kathleen Burke released a ruling invalidating the referendum question. Early voting had started, so while the question still appeared on the ballot, votes on the matter were not to be counted.</p>



<p>That decision has been vacated with Wednesday&#8217;s ruling. All votes cast for and against the referendum will now be counted and reported by the elections board during this month&#8217;s primary, Board of Elections spokesperson Max Bever confirmed Wednesday<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Referendum supporters blasted Burke’s ruling last month, saying she didn’t explain why the question shouldn’t be on the ballot. The judges also admitted their own confusion over the lack of details in the decision.</p>



<p>“Like the parties, we are left guessing as to the bases for the circuit court’s ruling because the lower court gave no reasons for its ruling.”</p>

<p>Michael Glassner, president of the Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance, which is among the group that sued, criticized the ruling allowing the referendum to proceed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing has changed: the mayor’s property title tax increase is still a bad idea. It will make it harder to create and provide affordable housing for the hard-working families who need it,&#8221; Glassner said in a statement.</p>



<p>Supporters estimate the rate hike would raise about $100 million annually, which would be reserved to build housing and provide outreach services to people experiencing homelessness.</p>



<p>The measure&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/11/14/25-city-council-members-ditch-meeting-about-citys-homelessness-crisis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">stalled under former Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration</a>. Johnson supported the plan during his mayoral campaign, and it has&nbsp;become one of his signature efforts under his progressive legislative agenda. </p>



<p>Proponents of Bring Chicago Home championed the appeals court&#8217;s ruling. </p>



<p>&#8220;We look forward to keeping up our efforts to reach hundreds of thousands of voters about their opportunity to vote yes for a fair and sustainable plan to fund housing, care for the homeless and ask wealthy real estate corporations to pay their fair share,&#8221; Maxica Williams, chair of the End Homelessness Ballot Initiative Committee and board president of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said in statement.</p>

164193,"<p>WEST LOOP — A 47-year-old man was seriously injured after being hit with a metal object in West Loop, police said.</p>



<p>At 12:02 a.m. Saturday, a man and woman were standing in an alley in the 600 block of West Randolph Street when another man walked up and began hitting the 47-year-old with a metal object, said Kellie Bartoli, a spokeswoman with the Chicago Police Department.</p>



<p>After the incident, the man then fled westbound, Bartoli said.</p>



<p>The 47-year-old man was taken to Stroger Hospital where he was listed in serious condition, Bartoli said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An argument over money may have led to the attack, police said, and the victim may have known the attacker.  </p>

<p>Cardenas faced off against union organizer <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/demayforthe12th/"" target=""_blank"">Pete DeMay</a>,  <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""ormer Child Care Director Martha Rangel, (opens in a new tab)"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/Martharangelforchange/about/?ref=page_internal"" target=""_blank"">former child care director Martha Rangel</a> and <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/JoseRico19/"" target=""_blank"">Jose Rico</a>, a former CPS principal who worked for the Obama Administration.</p>



<p>With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Cardenas got 50.3 percent of the vote, according to the Board of Elections. He needed to get more than 50 percent for an outright victory and avoid a runoff. </p>



<p>DeMay and Rico both got 17 percent of the vote. Rangel garnered 15.6 percent.</p>



<p>Vote-by-mail ballots have yet to be calculated, but it&#8217;s unclear if there are enough to lower Cardenas under the 50-percent threshold.</p>



<p>Cardenas could not be reached immediately Tuesday night.</p>



<p>DeMay, a union organizer for Workers United — a Service Employees International Union affiliate — campaigned on addressing public safety concerns and bringing more funding to neighborhood schools and parks and tackling environmental justice issues.</p>



<p>Rico, a senior vice president for community impact at United Way Metro Chicago and former executive director of the White House Initiative on Education Excellence for Hispanics under the Obama administration, campaigned on revitalizing business districts in the ward, advocating for more education funding for schools in the ward and tackling environmental pollution in the neighborhood.</p>



<p>Last month, the three challengers defeated petition challenges and the Board of Elections decided their names would make the ballot. </p>



<p>In 2015, Cardenas ran unopposed for his fourth term after DeMay was knocked off the ballot.</p>



<p>Cardenas was first elected to office in 2003.</p>



<p>The 12th Ward includes parts of Little Village, Back of the Yards, Brighton Park and McKinley Park neighborhoods.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first I could only do 30, then 100. Now I do 200 push-ups a day,&#8221; Rodriguez said. &#8220;I challenge the kids, my peers, people on social media. I could show you so many messages from people saying they get motivated from seeing me do my push-ups in the morning.</p>



<p>&#8220;This time in my life is about proving [to] people that you can do it. If you put the work in every single day, you can see progress.&#8221;</p>



<p>The strength challenge — which Rodriguez plans to do all year — is one of the many ways in which the 33-year-old motivates young people and his network to be the best version of themselves and to grow, whether that&#8217;s in fitness, schoolwork or job training. It&#8217;s part of his motto that&#8217;s made him a mentor in the Humboldt Park community.</p>



<p>Rodriguez is the violence prevention director at the Puerto Rican Cultural Center and co-owner of the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/battlebandera/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Battle Bandera Boxing Club</a> for youth at 2619 W. Division St. He&#8217;s also one of five peacekeepers featured in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpJ0WWLUysU"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">WTTW&#8217;s &#8220;Firsthand: Peacekeepers</a>,&#8221; a documentary series premiering Monday about community leaders striving to prevent and interrupt violence in Chicago’s neighborhoods.</p>



<p>Rodriguez has worked in violence prevention for four years with the cultural center, a newer organization in Humboldt Park&#8217;s violence prevention scene. He leads a team in de-escalating gang conflicts and conflicts at local high schools, responding to shootings and working with juveniles and others at risk of street violence.</p>



<p>Last summer, Rodriguez and his team converted half of their office into a boxing gym, becoming an outlet where young people can work on conflict resolution.</p>



<p>Battle Bandera Boxing Club offers youth classes, mentorship and job training, as well as space to do homework and access other social services with on-site case workers. Rodriguez, who coached youth basketball for 10 years and was a youth caseworker before his current role at the cultural center, said he makes sure to connect with every kid who comes into Battle Bandera. </p>

<p>Rodriguez said he has seen kids who initially couldn&#8217;t jump rope grow to hitting the bags with confidence and strength and wanting to go to college. The WTTW documentary also tracks the progress of the boxing club&#8217;s young people. </p>



<p>&#8220;Violence prevention is not just helping the bad kids,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s some kids that just need the mentorship that come in and you&#8217;ll see them change in six months.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rodriguez was born and raised in Humboldt Park. His parents were among the founders of the Spanish Cobras street gang in the 1970s, he said. </p>



<p>Since graduating college from Concordia University Chicago in 2018, he&#8217;s been working to reclaim the streets from gangs and create a more peaceful community, he said.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s often out in the community, talking to young people, business owners and neighbors and working with other violence prevention responders to lead peace marches, organize sporting events and assist people experiencing homelessness. As seen in the documentary, Rodriguez&#8217;s name and reputation are known among youth in gangs, in his gym and in schools.</p>



<p>&#8220;People see me doing good, and good overpowers everything,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s contagious. People are changing because they see change is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Rodriguez has seen images of himself at bus stops and billboards promoting the WTTW series. It&#8217;s surreal to get mainstream recognition for his work, and it&#8217;s exciting to share it with more people, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a great opportunity to showcase the importance of violence prevention workers. All of the work we do is not one job title or job description,&#8221; Rodriguez said. &#8220;The most important part for me right now is to show not only the power of it, but importance of investing in it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The group recently received a state grant to expand its work in Logan Square, Hermosa, Avondale and Belmont Cragin.</p>



<p>Edgar Vargas, a local filmmaker who directed Rodriguez&#8217;s segment for the documentary, wants viewers to realize that finding a solution to gang violence is everyone&#8217;s responsibility.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I learned from Adrian is consistency, that it&#8217;s hard when they don&#8217;t have the funding, but even if he didn&#8217;t have funding, the youth would not stop calling,&#8221; Vargas said.</p>



<p>Vargas sees Rodriguez as carrying the torch of Humboldt Park activist and organizer José “Cha Cha” Jiménez, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/01/14/how-jose-cha-cha-jimenez-empowered-chicago-puerto-ricans-he-was-a-true-revolutionary/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">who died last month</a>.</p>



<p>Like many in the area, Rodriguez was influenced by Jiménez&#8217;s community-centered work. He&#8217;s now teaching kids he works with about that &#8220;old-school&#8221; way of community organizing and looking out for one another, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I was 17, who did I look at?&#8221; Rodriguez said. &#8220;They see how I move and what I am doing in the neighborhood and it gives them different ways of doing things. I&#8217;m just trying to teach them a little bit, because there&#8217;s nobody teaching. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m there for: I&#8217;m a teacher of the streets.&#8221;</p>



<p>The &#8220;Firsthand&#8221; series can be watched as a full series or as individual segments <a href=""http://wttw.com/firsthand"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">online</a> starting Monday.</p>

397538,"<p>MCKINLEY PARK —&nbsp;A plan to relocate a Dunkin’ Donuts to a congested corner of McKinley Park received pushback from the alderman and neighbors, who said a drive-thru would make the area more dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the plan, developer Raina Archer would move the Dunkin’ Donuts inside the 35th/Archer Orange Line station to a lot near the corner of South Archer Avenue and South Leavitt Street. While the plan does not require a zoning change, it does require a special-use permit for the drive-thru, officials said.</p>



<p>Ald. George Cardenas (12th) said at a virtual meeting Wednesday the developer circumvented his office when getting a special-use permit to make way for the Dunkin&#8217; Donuts at 3542-3560 S. Archer Ave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, site owner Sanjeev Khatau received permit approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals.</p>



<p>Cardenas said the Zoning Board of Appeals “erroneously” listed the project in the wrong ward and approved a special-use permit. Now, building permits issued previously for the project have been “voided” until the plan can be vetted by the community, Cardenas said at the meeting.</p>



<p>Zoning attorney Nick Ftikas, who represents Raina Archer, outlined the plan for a 1,350-square-foot Dunkin’ Donuts that would include a single drive-thru lane. The lot would preserve 29 off-street parking spaces. The franchise would be open 6 a.m.-3 a.m. daily, and the drive-thru lane would operate 24 hours a day.</p>



<p>The location would bring 20 employees to the site with a goal to hire from the neighborhood, the development team said.</p>



<p>Ftikas said the plan would improve the corner with landscaping.</p>



<p>The team worked with the Chicago Department of Transportation and the Department of Planning and Development to meet all city codes and standards, the development team said.</p>



<p>But Cardenas said there was “a major issue with cross-departmental coordination” in the city, allowing for the approval of the permit without engaging community.</p>



<p>Neighbors and Cardenas said the Archer and Leavitt intersection is a “treacherous corner” in McKinley Park, and adding a drive-thru would increase traffic and make it more dangerous.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img data-recalc-dims=""1"" loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1132"" height=""776"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-6.23.15-PM.png?resize=1132%2C776&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-397540"" /></figure>



<p>From 2013-2017, there were 18 car crashes at the intersection, including one crash that involved a bicyclist and another involving a pedestrian, Cardenas said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>McKinley Park resident Cristina Martinez said she was concerned about the safety of pedestrians crossing the corner. And the plan goes against the neighborhood’s goal of becoming more pedestrian-friendly, she said. </p>



<p>“I’ve been almost hit several times,” Martinez said. “My neighbor was hit by a car there … and he died as a result of those injuries.”</p>



<p>Cardenas said the plan for the Dunkin’ Donuts doesn&#8217;t align with the vision of community members, who have identified the location as a potential site for transit-oriented development. The spot would be “perfect” for a walkable, mixed-use development since its near an Orange Line station, he said. </p>



<p>Ftikas said the site can&#8217;t be used for transit-oriented development because the Family Dollar there has a 10-year lease that was inherited by Khatau, Ftikas said. Because of the lease, they wouldn’t be able to create a larger development, Ftikas contended.</p>



<p>Instead, their goal is to “revitalize the corner as a starting point,” Ftikas said.</p>



<p>One McKinely Park resident, who is also a Dunkin&#8217; Donus employee, supported the plan for the relocation, but the move was largely opposed by people attending the virtual meeting.</p>



<p>Cardenas said nothing will happen at the site until he receives additional feedback from neighbors.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have some work to do &#8230; . There is no way that this is going to be the finished product,&#8221; Cardenas said.</p>

<p>And the winner is &#8230;</p>



<p>Caroline Rendon, of Rogers Park. Caroline was chosen at random to win the raffle, getting Block Club merch. Caroline&#8217;s dressed up as a classic Chicago corner bar, complete with an Old Style banner.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love I love dive bars, and that&#8217;s the main reason for this costume,&#8221; Caroline said. &#8220;But I also value the role neighborhood bars play in building community and gathering people together.&#8221;</p>

710252,"<p>WEST TOWN — A West Town hot dog stand has undergone a major rebrand — and its new owners have added breakfast, plant-based options and booze alongside Chicago street-food classics.</p>



<p>Modern Relish has taken over the former Duk&#8217;s Red Hots, 636 N. Ashland Ave., which opened 70 years ago and grew into a local chain with more than a dozen locations at one point.</p>



<p>All but one Duk&#8217;s Red Hots closed over the years: the original beloved but well-worn West Town spot known for its colorful signs and cheap eats.</p>



<p>Last year, husband-and-wife duo Tony Pagliuca and Angela Villanueva <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/11/09/duks-red-hots-in-west-town-last-of-local-chain-will-rebrand-in-the-new-year/"">took over the last Duk&#8217;s location</a> and oversaw extensive renovations to the property at the corner of Ashland and Erie. They held a grand opening for Modern Relish last week.</p>



<p>In addition to a new indoor space and kitchen, the couple has expanded the patio and added outdoor seating on the north side of the building.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re also introducing a range of breakfast items, vegan dogs and burgers, as well as beer, wine, mimosas and, in the next few weeks, slushy cocktails.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a modern Chicago-style hot dog stand,&#8221; Pagliuca said. &#8220;We wanted to make it really comfortable and nice, not just a greasy kind of joint. &#8230; But really the concept is about just modernizing the hot dog experience. We want to elevate that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Owner Mervyn Dukatt opened Duk’s on Ashland Avenue in the mid-’50s with partner Donald Marsalle.</p>



<p>Dukatt and Marsalle called their hot dog stand Donald Duk’s Red Hots, which soon landed the business in hot water with a corporation known as Disney, according to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.viennabeef.com/duks-red-hots"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">a brief history published by Vienna Beef</a>. </p>



<p>The owners removed “Donald” from the name and went on to sell Chicago street food for decades: Polishes and Italian beefs, but also deeper cuts like tamales, gravy bread and pizza puffs.</p>



<p>For the past 20 years, the face of the hot dog stand has been manager Carol Chavez, a mainstay behind the counter who often greeted customers by name. Like other longtime employees, Chavez is sticking around at Modern Relish. On a recent weekday morning, she was busy prepping classic Chicago dog toppings.</p>



<p>&#8220;She really helped us transition very smoothly because she knows the business,&#8221; Pagliuca said. </p>



<p>Pagliuca and Villanueva signed a lease for the Duk&#8217;s location late last fall after years of working in corporate jobs for McDonald&#8217;s and at other companies.</p>



<p>It was their longtime dream to run a &#8220;classic, Chicago-style hot dog stand,&#8221; Pagliuca said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I grew up in Chicago, born and raised on the South Side, in Pilsen. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve lived most of my life. And we always wanted to have a simple hot dog stand. For years we talked about this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Toward the end of last year, I said, &#8216;Are we going to try this or not?'&#8221;</p>



<p>Paglicua and Villanueva weren&#8217;t able to buy the Duk&#8217;s name, so they came up with a new one: Modern Relish, to reflect their vision for an updated hot dog stand.</p>



<p>Renovations were completed in about six weeks this winter and spring, which included adding the new patio and a host of interior fixes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Basically, we stripped the interior down to the studs, we redid electrical, plumbing, lighting, and then we built it back up, put in all the finishes,&#8221; Paglicua said. &#8220;We reconfigured the service area; no more sitting counter. And we wanted to expand our beverage offerings, so we needed more space on that side.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those beverages include not only staples like milkshakes and sodas, but also an array of beer, wine, mimosas — and, soon, several slushy cocktails like iced margaritas and vodka lemonade.</p>



<p>Pagliuca hopes neighbors take advantage of the outdoor spaces to enjoy a drink and a snack or a meal. He plans to convert a shipping container into an outdoor bar on the south patio, too.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the spring, summer, obviously we want to be able to utilize the patio all the time,&#8221; Pagliuca said. &#8220;In the fall and winter, we&#8217;re considering doing either a tent, or those little igloos you see, just to get through some of the cooler weather.&#8221;</p>



<p>And while the original Duk&#8217;s sign is gone, the iconic Vienna Beef hot dog sign, complete with curving arrow, remains. It will soon be painted and refurbished, Pagliuca said.</p>

<p>Modern Relish will also unveil its breakfast menu over the next few weeks. Options will include egg sandwiches, burritos, coffee and grab-and-go items like fruit cups and parfaits. The restaurant will sell pastries from nearby West Town Bakery.</p>



<p>Since its grand opening last week, Pagliuca gotten a favorable response from neighbors, especially to the plant-based hot dogs, burgers and &#8220;chicken&#8221; sandwiches and tenders, he said.</p>



<p>As Modern Relish gets its footing in West Town, Pagliuca and Villanueva could open other locations, similar to Duk&#8217;s, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;If we can establish a strong brand here with the quality food that we&#8217;re looking for and that modern, umbrella feeling of the Chicago-style hot dog, we&#8217;ll definitely look at other locations,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>The West Town location is <a href=""https://www.modernrelish.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">available for parties and catering</a>. Delivery is available through various apps.</p>



<p>Modern Relish is open 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday, with plans to extend hours to 7 a.m.-9 p.m. daily soon.</p>

491238,"<p>UPTOWN — A community health clinic has relocated in Uptown to make way for the neighborhood&#8217;s latest apartment development. </p>



<p>Tenants of the strip mall at 4501 N. Sheridan Road have moved out as the building is set to be demolished and turned into 59 apartments. That includes Sunnyside Health Center, which moved to 4140 N. Broadway. </p>



<p>The move was announced in a note to clients posted at the old building, which is closed. Sunnyside&#8217;s new clinic has yet to open. A spokesperson for parent organization Near North Health did not respond to a request for comment Monday. </p>



<p>Just Pawn, which neighbored the health center in the Sheridan building, has relocated to 4445 N. Broadway. Royal Coin Laundry, also in the strip mall, has closed. </p>

<p>The nonprofit community health center&#8217;s future in Uptown was thrown for a loop when Mavrek Development bought the strip mall in April for $2.65 million, property records show. </p>



<p>Mavrek announced the <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/02/11/developer-to-replace-uptown-strip-mall-with-luxury-apartment-building/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">59-unit, mixed-use complex</a> last year as the development company&#8217;s latest project in Uptown. The developer applied for a demolition permit for the strip mall, but it has not yet been granted, city records show. </p>

<p>The five-story development will include 7,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor at Sheridan Road and Sunnyside Avenue. On the upper floors will be a mix of studios and one- and two-bedrooms, Mavrek principal Adam Friedberg previously said.</p>



<p>Most units will have balconies, and there will be 35 parking spaces. A gym and co-working lounge are also planned. </p>



<p>Mavrek estimates the project, dubbed Forty-Five 01, will be completed this year, according to its website. </p>



<p>This will be Mavrek’s second development within a two-block stretch of Sheridan.</p>



<p>Mavrek built the Mondrian, a <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/09/10/uptown-day-care-being-redeveloped-into-30-unit-apartment-building/"">30-unit apartment building</a> at 4714 N.

139006,"<p>HYDE PARK — It’s the last period of a warm spring day at Hyde Park High School, but freshmen in one classroom are sinking into down jackets, or have their sweatshirts pulled up over their heads. On the left side of the room sit mostly female students. On the right side, the teenage boys laugh quietly or make jokes. </p>



<p>Their postures aren’t surprising because this day, like every week for almost five months, it’s time to talk about sex. </p>



<p>Today’s lesson is about decision-making and consent. </p>



<p>What does consent mean, ask the instructors, Julia Goldstein and Rahul Kukreja, two 19-year-old pre-med students from the University of Chicago full of nervous energy. They’re both from the nonprofit Peer Health Exchange which contracts to bring in university students to teach high schoolers about sex education.</p>



<p>A student sitting near the front in a black head wrap and a bright blue puffy jacket raises her hand. It’s not just about someone saying yes, she says, but “it’s about genuinely wanting to do something with their own free will.”</p>



<p>That’s right, Goldstein and Kukreja both nod. </p>



<p>With a growing national movement against sexual harassment on campuses and in workplaces, and after the revelation of widespread abuse in Chicago Public Schools, more schools are teaching the meaning and practice of consent. Data from the U.S. Sexuality Information and Education Council show that teens in Illinois report higher rates of forced sexual encounters than the national average. </p>



<p>In the spring, legislators in Springfield passed a bill that mandates more comprehensive sex education. That includes writing into the state’s school code an explicit definition of consent. The bill is waiting for the governor’s signature. </p>



<p>“Teaching consent is critical in reducing both intended and unintended violence,” said Brittany Merritt, executive director and former Chicago program director at Peer Health Exchange. “It’s a critical skill for young people to develop more broadly. We teach affirmative consent and the onus is on both parties.”</p>



<p>While sex education is not mandatory in Illinois, any district that chooses to teach it has to include both consent, information about contraception and abstinence-based education. In Chicago, the district chose to mandate it for its schools. Health educators helped put together what advocates consider a mostly comprehensive sex-education curriculum. </p>



<p>But it doesn’t yet include consent — the district said they are in the process of adding that content. </p>



<p>Teachers may use the curriculum or schools may hire a non-profit like Peer Health Exchange to teach it or another series of lessons approved by the Office of Student Health and Wellness. </p>



<p>However, just how schools teach sex education can vary widely. Many parents in Chicago say their students were never taught sexual education, or that the lessons were spotty and inconsistent. </p>



<p>On consent education, Peer Health Exchange updates its curriculum as definitions of terms like consent change. For example, until several years ago people widely assumed that sexual activity was OK unless a partner said “no.” Now the group teaches affirmative consent.</p>



<p>“The onus is now on all the parties to express what they do and don’t want,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>then listen</em>&nbsp;to their partner” said Lisa Walker, who helped craft the curriculum taught by Peer Health Exchange volunteers.&nbsp;“That’s what it’s about rather than ‘it’s a yes unless they say no.’ “</p>



<p>It’s a lesson that sexual health educators hope students will take into all parts of life.</p>



<p>“This is how we set boundaries as children, how we prevent child abuse, how we help young people feel safe in their own bodies,” said Aisha Chaudhri, reproductive manager at EverThrive, a&nbsp;community health non-profit based in Chicago. Chaudhri helped the district write its curriculum as the education manager at the Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, and has reviewed outside sexual education curriculum taught in Chicago schools.</p>



<p>“It teaches them to ask what they need not just in sexual relationships but in life,” she said.</p>



<p>In the classroom at Hyde Park, both the peer educators and students take examples from real life as they discuss the topics of the day. “What kind of non-sexual things might someone try and coerce you to do?” Kukreja asks. </p>



<p>Drinking alcohol, suggests one girl. “Stealing a car,” suggests a male student, eliciting a small wave of giggling. </p>



<p>Goldstein doesn’t miss a beat. “Right. If [you] say anything other than yes, consent has not been given.” </p>



<p>For the student in the blue puffy jacket, the awkwardness of the Peer Health Exchange classes is still worth enduring to learn how to better navigate issues teenagers face.</p>



<p>“Some students might not have a lot of knowledge, and they may laugh, but it’s very informative,” she said. </p>

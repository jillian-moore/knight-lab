<p>SOUTH SHORE — A cannabis dispensary is in the works for a vacant property on Stony Island Avenue, and company officials are working to open the business by the end of the year, they said.</p>



<p>Officials with Sway, which recently opened <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/04/09/sway-northalsteds-new-weed-dispensary-opens-friday/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the state’s first LGBTQ+- and minority-owned dispensary</a> in Lakeview, detailed their plans for a South Shore dispensary at a community meeting Monday.</p>



<p>Sway would lease a vacant, 2,800-square-foot building at 6948 S. Stony Island Ave., said Edie Moore, co-owner of Sway and a South Shore resident. The dispensary would feature a standard dispensary layout with a publicly accessible entry, a limited-access sales floor and restricted areas for inventory.</p>



<p>A large &#8220;flex room&#8221; with space for pop-ups, meetings, luncheons and other community programs would be in the entryway. Silver Star Protection Group would handle security at the dispensary.</p>



<p>Monday&#8217;s community meeting was required ahead of the project&#8217;s Zoning Board of Appeals hearing, which is expected in September, Moore said. If approved, construction would follow with the goal of opening by the end of the year, she said.</p>



<p>Sway will spend &#8220;nearly $1 million&#8221; to renovate the building, consultant Amiel Harper said, though officials did not give an exact amount. The business has applied for a county grant to cover a small portion of construction costs, but it has not yet received any government funding for the project, Moore said.</p>

<p>Sway, whose brand name is meant to evoke feelings of dance and movement,&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/04/09/sway-northalsteds-new-weed-dispensary-opens-friday/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">opened its first dispensary</a>&nbsp;in April at&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/09/14/owner-of-town-hall-pub-in-lakeview-dies-of-covid-19-everyone-who-knew-him-still-cant-believe-hes-gone/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the former Town Hall Pub</a>, 3340 N. Halsted St. in Lakeview.</p>



<p>The company is owned by Moore, a cannabis policy advocate; entrepreneur Kevin Hauswirth; and <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/06/06/art-and-pep-film-about-40-year-love-story-between-owners-of-lgbtq-bar-sidetrack-streaming-now/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Art Johnston and Jose &#8220;Pepe&#8221; Peña</a>, husbands and LGBTQ+ activists who own legendary Lakeview bar Sidetrack.</p>



<p>Tonya Trice, executive director of the South Shore Chamber, spoke in support of Sway&#8217;s plans at Monday&#8217;s meeting. Moore is a former program manager for South Shore&#8217;s Special Service Area No. 42, which is overseen by the chamber and includes the proposed Sway location.</p>



<p>Sway can be a &#8220;catalyst&#8221; for other businesses to come to the neighborhood, Trice said.</p>



<p>&#8220;South Shore [residents] have to understand that in order to revitalize and bring new economic opportunities to the community, we have to do different things,&#8221; Trice said. &#8220;Dispensaries are thriving all across the city. &#8230; There&#8217;s no reason why we cannot attract those same resources right here to the South Shore community and continue to keep our dollars right here in the community.&#8221;</p>



<p>A few dozen attendees at Monday&#8217;s meeting largely showed support for the plans, with several neighbors saying they were relieved to learn the plans were for a cannabis dispensary and not a smoke shop.</p>

<p>The company wants to increase access to legal cannabis in communities most affected by its criminalization, officials have said. Should Sway open in South Shore, it would be one of only a few dispensaries south of Roosevelt Road.</p>



<p>&#8220;You go east of the Dan Ryan and south of Bronzeville, all of that&#8217;s an opportunity for us to have more commerce in our neighborhood,&#8221; Harper said.</p>



<p>Mission Dispensaries, at 8554 S. Commercial Ave. in South Chicago — of which <a href=""https://www.chicagomag.com/chicago-magazine/january-2019/will-illinois-help-fix-the-weed-industrys-diversity-problem/"">Moore was a part-owner</a> — is the nearest dispensary to South Shore. Spark’d in the South Loop is the next closest, about 8 miles away.</p>



<p>Johnston told Block Club earlier this year Sway&#8217;s Northalsted shop was the first of at least three planned dispensaries. But for now, the company is scaling back those plans to focus on its Halsted and Stony Island locations, Moore said this week.</p>



<p>The 1937 Group, a minority-owned cannabis company which has&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/03/19/minority-owned-cannabis-company-aims-to-open-dispensary-in-south-shore/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">also announced plans to open a dispensary in South Shore</a>, held public meetings on its proposal for 7105 S. Yates Blvd. earlier this year.</p>



<p>&#8220;As a cannabis business owner and a cannabis activist, I support all the social equity dispensaries opening, especially on the South Side,&#8221; Moore said when asked whether South Shore could support two dispensaries if they both open.</p>



<p>&#8220;The South Side is a dispensary desert — no shade to Mission over there. I love them, they&#8217;re friends of mine, but they&#8217;re just not enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>WEST RIDGE — Jhopsef Stiven arrived in Texas in late September, thinking his journey from Venezuela was over.</p>



<p>Then an official asked him for documentation and told him to get on a bus. He had two choices: Chicago or New York.</p>



<p>“I’d never heard of Chicago before that day. But I loved the name ‘Chicago,’” Stiven said. “So I figured, yeah, I’ll go to Chicago.”</p>

<p>Stiven, 20, is one of the more than&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/HeatherCherone/status/1591484587410079745"">3,600 people</a>&nbsp;who have arrived in Chicago since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott started busing people to Democratic-led cities in late August in protest of federal immigration policies.</p>



<p>Local officials brought Stiven to the YMCA, 2424 W. Touhy Ave., which&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/09/20/west-ridges-shuttered-ymca-building-being-used-to-house-migrants-bused-in-from-texas/"">reopened</a>&nbsp;to serve as temporary housing for migrants.</p>



<p>In just a few weeks, Stiven found a job, befriended other migrants and explored his new surroundings, he said.</p>



<p>“I’m getting to know the city little by little. I love the culture here. People are very friendly, and it feels pretty tranquil,” Stiven said.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Buses, Jungle And Mountains</strong></h2>



<p>Stiven has always made work his priority, he said. He loved playing indoor soccer growing up in Caracas, Venezuela, but largely gave up the sport once he started working as a teenager, he said.</p>



<p>When Venezuela’s economy tanked, causing soaring unemployment and leaving many without basic necessities, his paternal grandmother, who raised him, moved the family to Bogotá, Colombia.</p>



<p>“There just wasn’t an ability to grow or make life better for us if we had stayed,” Stiven said.</p>



<p>As he grew older, he traveled to Lima, Peru, on his own in the pursuit of better-paying jobs. When the pandemic hit, he returned to Columbia, he said.</p>



<p>“I didn’t want to spend the pandemic alone. I wanted to be with my grandma,” Stiven said.</p>



<p>As countries started easing pandemic restrictions and businesses reopened, Stiven returned to Peru and went on to Santiago, Chile, he said. Through a friend, Stiven found a job making furniture for big-box stores.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, that friend asked Stiven if he’d like to go with him to the United States to get a better job. Stiven worried the trip would be too difficult for just two people. And he was doing well in Chile., he thought.</p>



<p>But his friend persisted and said they would be part of a larger group heading north, he remembered. Stiven decided to go for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From what he’d heard, there were opportunities in the United States for someone like him to find a job making enough to buy a car, a home and support a family, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a suitcase and a bus ticket, Stiven started the six-week journey to America.</p>

<p>Taking buses through South America, Stiven arrived at Necoclí, Colombia, to catch a ferry to the jungle between Colombia and Panama called the<a href=""https://www.refugeesinternational.org/reports/2022/6/16/life-on-the-edge-of-the-darien-gap"">&nbsp;Darién Gap</a>, he said.</p>



<p>“The jungle was difficult. You have to respect it because it’s so dangerous, and it took us six days to cross it,” Stiven said. “You have to have a lot of patience because it’s a very hard environment.”</p>





<p>Stiven and his group endured hot conditions, relying on streams and rivers for drinking water, he said. As the group walked north, the jungle gave way to mountains, which made it harder to find fresh water, he said. But the mountains gave them hope, too. They were almost to Panama.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We had to go over [the mountains] because once we did we’d be on the side of the jungle that’s inside Panama,” he said. “The mission from then on was just getting out of that jungle and getting back on the trip north using buses.”</p>



<p>By that point, the group was out of food and money, Stiven said. He and his travel mates contacted family back home, pooled the money relatives sent and bought supplies for th erest of the journey, Stiven said. After two days, the group continued north to Costa Rica, through Central America and finally Mexico, he said.</p>



<p>Stiven had heard of corrupt cops, cartels and harsh immigration officials taking advantage of migrants in Mexico but he and his group didn’t run into trouble, he said.</p>



<p>“Thank God nothing happened crossing through Mexico. There were people you had to be careful to avoid but thank God nothing happened when we crossed there,” he said.</p>



<p>After successfully crossing the Mexico-United States border, Stiven opted for the bus to Chicago, a city he didn’t know at all, instead of the trip to New York, a place he recognized from reruns of the TV show, “The King of Queens.”</p>



<p>“When we were on the bus leaving Texas, I felt very happy. I had achieved my goal. And now that I was leaving Texas, I would have more opportunities in Chicago for work,” Stiven said.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Finding A Job In An Unknown City</strong></h2>



<p>Once Stiven arrived in Chicago, he was sent to the YMCA shelter in West Ridge. Organizers gave migrants a meal, showed them around and told them they were free to come and go as they looked for work, Stiven said.</p>



<p>Stiven quickly joined a group exploring the neighborhood to look for a job. Soon, businesses near the shelter started posting signs letting migrants know positions had been filled or they weren’t hiring, Stiven said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To increase his chances of finding a job, Stiven struck out on his own, he said. But it wasn’t easy. He didn’t know the city and he had no phone or cash. He didn’t know if the people he’d be asking for work would speak Spanish, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each day, Stiven would start his job hunt walking in a different direction from the shelter, he said.</p>



<p>One day, he hiked to Clark Street in Rogers Park and landed a job working at a corner store in mid-October, he said.</p>



<p>“The majority of the people I found on that street were Latinos — Mexican, Venezuelan and all types of people who speak Spanish,” Stiven said. “When I found that street with so many people who speak Spanish, it really opened a lot of opportunities for work.”</p>



<p>For several weeks, Stiven settled into a routine commuting between the store and the shelter. He used some of his first paychecks to get clothes and a bicycle, he said. The bike would work until he could save up for a car, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because for me, a car is a way to open more doors to travel to places that I’ve never been to before,” Stiven said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He began to pick up short English phrases to talk with customers: “Hi, how can I help you?” and “Hi, man; how are you?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in years, Stiven had downtime to enjoy soccer again, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, I play with some of the other guys who are here for fun. It’s also good for my mental health and to deal with stress,” Stiven said in October. “Because it’s not good to just only be thinking about work all the time.”</p>



<p>By late November, Stiven was no longer working at the corner store and was back hunting for a job, he said in text messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some migrants, mainly couples, were relocated from the shelter to hotels, Stiven said. Just as quickly, a steady influx of new faces from Texas arrived to take their spots at the shelter, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stiven said he’d like to save money for an apartment. For now, he is passing on what he knows to help others at the shelter get settled — where to look for a job, where in the city folks speak Spanish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’re still coming here to Chicago, but now in the winter. I’m not sure what they’re going to do with us all,” he said.</p>

150844,"
<p>CHICAGO — A 47-year-old woman was shot late Wednesday in West Ridge.</p>



<p>At 10:46 p.m., the woman was found in an alley in the 6000 block of North Fairfield Street, police said. She&#8217;d been shot in her right leg.</p>



<p>The woman was taken to St. Francis Hospital, where her condition was not available but she was listed as &#8220;stable,&#8221; police said.</p>



<p>The woman was &#8220;highly intoxicated&#8221; and was not immediately able to give further information, a police source said.</p>



<p>No one was in custody. An investigation was ongoing.</p>
"
475205,"
<p>CHICAGO — People across Chicago — and all around the United States — reported their Comcast Xfinity-backed internet going out Tuesday morning, causing a morning scramble to get online.</p>



<p>Some in Chicago reported having internet issues as early as around midnight, but reports of a mass outage started about 7:30 a.m. Central. Some people reported their internet returning after 8 a.m., but others continued to have spotty or nonexistent service for several hours.</p>



<p>Chicago wasn&#8217;t the only part of the country suffering internet headaches. Widespread outages were reported in Indiana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and New Jersey. The Bay Area also saw an hours-long mass outage Monday night.</p>



<p>Hours after the mass outage, Comcast acknowledged the problem, tweeting it was the result of an unspecified &#8220;network issue&#8221; that was being investigated. The company apologized and said &#8220;service is now restoring for impacted customers.&#8221;</p>

We have addressed the issue and service is now restoring for impacted customers, as we continue to investigate the root cause. We apologize to those who were affected.</p>&mdash; Xfinity Support (@XfinitySupport) <a href=""https://twitter.com/XfinitySupport/status/1458113028935794703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">November 9, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>
</div></figure>



<p>People with other providers continued to have access to the internet.</p>



<p>Comcast&#8217;s outage came as many people continue to rely on internet to work or learn from home during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Nicolai Naranjo, who works in property management, rushed to a Dollop coffee shop at 345 E. Ohio St. to use its internet for work. The cafe was bustling with people grabbing coffee and using the internet.</p>



<p>&#8220;I rebooted my router and nothing. And that&#8217;s all I know in terms of technology, so I rushed here,&#8221; Naranjo said. &#8220;Thankfully, the internet is working here, but it disrupted my working morning. We all rely on the internet and it was quite disrupting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Representatives from the city&#8217;s Police Department and Office of Emergency Management and Communications said they had not been affected by the outage. The CTA also said it was fine.</p>



<p>But some agencies did experience hiccups. Metra wasn&#8217;t able to make PA announcements about delayed trains, though the trains themselves ran fine, a spokesperson said. In an email, Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) said his office&#8217;s phones were going straight to voicemail due to the outage. Some schools also experienced issues.</p>



<p>“Chicago Public Schools strives to ensure students have access to high-quality internet services and is aware that some of our schools were impacted by this morning&#8217;s Comcast outage that is now over,&#8221; a CPS spokesman said in a statement. &#8220;Internet and phone services will be restored, according to Comcast Xfinity officials.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many Chicagoans took to social media to share their frustration over the outage, with many also saying they were unable to reach customer support workers when trying to call Comcast. The company&#8217;s outage map, which shows outages across the country, also appeared to be down.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised it&#8217;s out,&#8221; said Felipe Fisher, of Edgewater. Fisher is an editor at an insurance broker and took to a Collectivo Coffee, 5425 N. Clark St., to use the internet. &#8220;I am surprised it&#8217;s going on this long and is this widespread.&#8221;</p>



<p>A barista there, Zoe D&#8217;Amato, said the cafe was busier than usual and they&#8217;d gotten five calls asking if they had internet. A row of tables was filled by people using their laptops. Several people were on Zoom calls and many had their email open.</p>



<p>Madison Meero, a K-12 theater teacher at a virtual charter school, normally works from home — but woke up this morning and realized she didn&#8217;t have internet. She headed to the Collectivo cafe so she could work.</p>



<p>But once Meero got to the cafe, she realized she didn&#8217;t have the headphones she needed and she had to buy a pair from a nearby Walgreens. Meero, who was teaching a kindergarten and first grade theater class, then used Zoom to work with the kids.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a little chaotic,&#8221; Meero said. But &#8220;it&#8217;s online school, so all of the students understand wifi issues.&#8221;</p>



<p>And at least a few people didn&#8217;t mind the outage.</p>



<p>One North Sider who has worked from home for years told his employers when his internet went down in the morning. He had a morning full of meetings lined up and didn&#8217;t go to them — even when his internet returned.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was gonna take a nap, but, actually, I took my dog for a walk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think maybe I am gonna watch my recording of John Oliver pretty soon.</p>



<p>&#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m relieved the internet&#8217;s down and it&#8217;s a story that was posted on news blogs and everybody knew about it. I&#8217;m always glad for a break from it. Everybody, at least in my line of work, they treat every meeting like it&#8217;s the end all, be all of existence — but in the end, most of them are just mildly necessary, I guess. It&#8217;s good to get away from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>SOUTH SHORE — Backers of a plan to keep South Shore residents in their homes amid the Obama Presidential Center&#8217;s construction are hopeful Mayor Brandon Johnson will put his full weight behind the slate of housing protections, though he hasn&#8217;t yet.</p>



<p>Ald. Desmon Yancy (5th) tried to introduce the South Shore Housing Preservation Ordinance <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/09/14/obama-center-gentrification-fears-lead-to-south-shore-affordable-housing-ordinance/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">to City Council earlier this month</a>. A technical problem prevented the City Clerk&#8217;s Office from properly receiving the ordinance, but it will be reintroduced at Wednesday&#8217;s council meeting, Yancy said.</p>



<p>If passed, the ordinance would secure benefits for South Shore renters and homeowners while bringing more affordable housing to the neighborhood.</p>



<p>The ordinance would, among other things:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Reserve all city-owned vacant lots in South Shore for affordable housing.</li>



<li>Create a pilot affordable housing program in South Shore requiring 60 percent of new housing developments to be reserved for&nbsp;households earning 30 percent of the <a href=""https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/renters/svcs/ami_chart.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">area median income</a>.

<p>Johnson has not directly answered which aspects of the South Shore ordinance he supports in the two weeks since its rollout.</p>



<p>The mayor supports “a benefits agreement that doesn’t push families out” of their communities, he said at a press conference after Yancy and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) joined organizers to introduce the legislation.</p>



<p>Johnson&#8217;s office did not answer Block Club&#8217;s detailed questions about the ordinance. Mayoral spokespeople issued a broad statement last week voicing support for housing stability and economic prosperity in South Shore.</p>



<p>Pressed for specifics this week, spokespeople declined to elaborate.</p>



<p>&#8220;This administration is committed to transparency, expediency, providing housing for the houseless and expanding the availability of affordable housing,&#8221; spokesperson Hannah Fierle said in a statement.</p>



<p>Yancy and some housing activists hope they can take the mayor&#8217;s sparse public comments on the ordinance as a sign he&#8217;s doing his due diligence, they said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m okay with it,&#8221; Yancy said. &#8220;I think that there’s been a lot of things on the plate right now as we&#8217;re moving into budget season. I understand there’s a commitment from his office to pass this ordinance, and now it&#8217;s just a matter of it moving through the pipeline.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It would be great if we can allocate money going into 2024 budget season and be able to close out the year with the passage of this ordinance,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The Johnson administration &#8220;has an intentional pace around how it analyzes and deals with legislation,&#8221; said Dixon Romeo, executive director of Not Me We and an Obama CBA Coalition member.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t anticipate that changing,&#8221; Romeo said. &#8220;I think that we’re going to continue to have discussions with them, and they’re going to continue to hear and see from the community that [the ordinance] is very much needed.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Organizers Fought For A Similar Ordinance In Woodlawn</h2>



<p>Taylor and Yancy&#8217;s predecessor, Leslie Hairston, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/07/24/obama-center-community-benefits-ordinance-can-be-chicagos-model-for-development-without-displacement-alds-say/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">introduced a wide-ranging community benefits agreement</a> to City Council in 2019 with support from the Obama CBA Coalition.</p>



<p>The proposal stalled for more than a year&nbsp;before then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/02/26/lightfoot-plans-to-spend-4-5-million-to-keep-woodlawn-residents-in-their-homes-near-obama-center/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">offered up a watered-down version</a>. The Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance passed in 2020 was <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/07/22/how-lightfoot-and-housing-activists-reached-an-uneasy-detente-in-the-battle-for-woodlawns-future/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">an uneasy compromise between the two proposals</a>.</p>



<p>But South Shore was left out of that compromise, leading organizers back to the drawing board to enact similar affordable housing protections for those neighbors.</p>



<p>Taylor, who frequently sparred with Lightfoot before the Woodlawn ordinance passed and is a co-sponsor of the South Shore ordinance, did not respond to Block Club&#8217;s requests for comment.</p>



<p>Yancy hopes that &#8220;we don’t run into the same sort of challenges&#8221; Taylor and others faced in pushing Lightfoot to support a community benefits agreement, said. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m betting on the people in office and the work that’s been done,&#8221; Yancy said when asked if he&#8217;s worried about similar pushback from the Johnson administration. &#8220;I think we’ll be okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Housing organizers trust Johnson to be a better negotiating partner <a href=""https://news.wttw.com/2023/05/10/analyzing-lori-lightfoot-s-legacy-combative-mayor-whose-reform-push-faltered-amid"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">than Lightfoot was</a>, Romeo said. </p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a difference between compromise, and taking a piece of legislation and wholesale cutting it at the neck,&#8221; Romeo said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t anticipate that happening with [Johnson] &#8230; because that’s not what this administration does or is about.&#8221;</p>



<p>The South Shore ordinance was introduced to aldermen with <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/03/10/as-obama-center-is-built-5th-ward-voters-overwhelmingly-back-affordable-housing-measures/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">overwhelming community support</a> and the backing of both affected aldermen after &#8220;<a href=""https://chicagomaroon.com/22511/news/students-south-side-community-groups-promote-commu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">close to a decade</a> of <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/04/30/south-shore-residents-call-for-neighborhood-unity-as-they-kick-off-campaign-against-displacement/"">engagement</a> with folks on this issue,&#8221; Romeo said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can’t think of something that’s hit City Council where so much work has been done on the front end to ensure what is represented here is representative of the needs of the neighborhood,&#8221; Romeo said.</p>



<p>That should be enough for city officials &#8220;to pounce on this and [pass] the most robust version of this as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Are More Protections On The Way?</h2>



<p>When asked what other community areas could benefit from legislation like the South Shore ordinance, the mayor&#8217;s office said housing protections &#8220;should be considered&#8221; elsewhere but did not say which communities nor why they needed them.</p>



<p>This month&#8217;s proposal is &#8220;just a start&#8221; in addressing South Shore residents&#8217; needs, Yancy said. The alderperson will explore other anti-displacement measures, &#8220;either through this ordinance or through the next piece of legislation that we push,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some folks are concerned about making sure we have other protections for the middle class — not just those who are low-income renters and not those who are homeowners, but what are we doing for people in the middle who are feeling some pain?&#8221; Yancy said. </p>



<p>5th Ward residents can ask questions or give feedback about the ordinance proposal by calling Yancy&#8217;s office at 773-324-5555 or emailing <a href=""mailto:ward05@cityofchicago.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ward05@cityofchicago.org</a>.</p>



<p>Activists said employment, sustainability, education and transportation agreements were needed in communities near the Obama Center as the 2019 community benefits agreement was introduced. But securing housing protections is the priority right now, Romeo said.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you’ve been displaced and can’t afford to live in the neighborhood, you don’t have access to the schools, access to the jobs, don’t even touch that transportation,&#8221; Romeo said. &#8220;Housing&#8217;s got to be the focus. Everything else has to build off that.&#8221;</p>

<p>CHICAGO — More than half of the district-run schools in Chicago’s <a href=""https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/chicago/2019/11/08/chicago-enrollment-drops-again-continuing-decades-long-trend/"">shrinking school system</a> are under utilized, with 10 more campuses landing on that list for a total of 253 under-enrolled schools, according to <a href=""https://cps.edu/About_CPS/Policies_and_guidelines/Pages/facilitystandards.aspx"">data released this week</a> by Chicago Public Schools.</p>



<p>The district calculates utilization using <a href=""https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/chicago/2019/11/08/chicago-school-enrollment-grow-or-shrink-search-by-school/"">20th-day enrollment</a> and the results of biennial facilities assessments, though the last comprehensive assessment was conducted in 2014-2015. Mandated by state law, the annual capacity calculations are closely watched barometers of how student enrollment patterns impact campuses. Parents and educators at overcrowded schools use the data to build support in their communities for campaigns for annexes and new facilities, while supporters at under-utilized schools monitor the numbers out of <a href=""https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/chicago/2019/05/02/small-school-grants/"">concern for the future of their campuses. </a></p>



<p><strong><em>Related: <a href=""https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/chicago/2019/11/08/chicago-enrollment-drops-again-continuing-decades-long-trend/"">Another year of enrollment declines, but Chicago holds on to title of third largest district</a></em></strong></p>



<p>The data does not include charter schools that own their own facilities or options programs that help students at risk of dropping out. Of the district’s 642 schools, about 500 are listed in the capacity numbers.</p>



<p>This school year, 35 schools with reported data are over capacity, which is defined as a building utilization of 110 percent or more, compared with 34 in 2018-19. Per the data, 206 schools were labeled “efficient,” meaning they are using 70 to 110 percent of the building’s ideal capacity, compared to 216 schools last year. </p>

<p>High schools most clearly illustrate the dramatic swing in Chicago’s enrollment, with some schools brimming at the seams and others hollowing out. Three majority Latino high schools — Von Steuben High School on the city’s Northwest Side, and John F. Kennedy High School and Hubbard High School on the Southwest Side — were the most overcrowded, with capacity rates of 144 percent, 156 percent and 135 percent respectively.</p>



<p>Six other high school campuses were less than 10 percent full, according to the district’s calculations. Two of those high schools — Tilden and Hirsch — are on the city’s South Side, while two others — Manley and Douglass high schools — are on the Far West Side. A fifth, Uplift High School, is located in the city’s Uptown neighborhood, and a sixth, Harper High School, is slated for closure as part of a four-school consolidation in Englewood, where a new STEM high school opened this year. Five of the six schools has a majority black student population.</p>



<p>The district released the figures this year with a caveat that they are only one data point used to determine investments in buildings and facilities and engage communities in discussions about their schools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Space utilization represents one of the many resources the district has available for stakeholders to learn more about the schools in their communities,” said a spokeswoman in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community groups also typically <a href=""https://chalkbeat.org/posts/chicago/2019/01/03/chicago-says-nearly-half-of-its-schools-are-under-enrolled-but-critics-challenge-district-formula/"">urge caution with the data,</a> arguing that capacity does not paint an accurate picture of what happens inside schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timothy Noonan, a parent of three Chicago Public Schools students and a parent rep on the Kellogg Elementary School Local School Council, said that parents at the 275-student elementary in the Beverly neighborhood are trying to build a case for a new addition to the building to replace an aging mobile unit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The capacity data lists the building as efficient — with 92 percent capacity — but that doesn’t portray the reality there, he said, where the gym doubles as a cafeteria. “The cafeteria workers are working while the kids are playing in the gym,” said Noonan. </p>



<p>What’s more, capacity calculations are based on a class size of 30 and, said Noonan, “no reflection on reality.” “These older schools have different sized, funky rooms, and some classrooms were reassigned from something else, like a library. Having normal-sized rooms is not the norm across buildings.”</p>



<p>An example of how enrollment can wax and wane, a few years ago, Kellogg was losing enrollment and a plan was floated to merge it with a nearby school. Parents fought the plan, a new principal was hired, and a widespread recruitment effort brought in more students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How other schools can stem enrollment losses is an ongoing conversation in many neighborhoods. A pair of parent advocacy groups this summer set up a two-day workshop on the West Side to <a href=""https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/chicago/2019/07/16/community-facility-planning/"">educate community members on alternatives to school closures</a> — from sharing vacant space with other schools or community groups to lobbying the district for different attendance boundaries or coming up with plans to boost enrollment.  </p>

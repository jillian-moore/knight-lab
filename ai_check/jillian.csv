<p>CHICAGO — With an ambitious pledge to end poverty within a generation, Mayor Lori Lightfoot hosted the Solutions Toward Ending Poverty Summit Thursday, a first step in a new approach to lift families out of poverty. </p>



<p>At the invite-only summit, Lightfoot set the table for a frank and open conversation about poverty in the city, and invited Chicagoans to speak plainly about the racism and systemic oppression that perpetuates poverty.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to talk about it. We&#8217;re not going to run away from it,&#8221; Lightfoot said. &#8220;We are going to raise the curtain… and fill that void with resources.&#8221;</p>

<p>Public officials, neighborhood leaders, business owners, social service providers, researchers, activists and artists were invited to participate in the summit at the Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The summit served as the launch for a public engagement period that will bring people to the table who are directly impacted by economic hardship but are often left out of the room when decisions are made, officials said. </p>



<p>Even as household incomes in Chicago have been on the rise, 22 percent of Chicagoans still live in conditions of poverty, according to census data.</p>



<p>At the summit, Lightfoot announced plans to rollout an agenda over the next few months that aims to dramatically increasing economic opportunity for the city&#8217;s most vulnerable people, including fines and fees reforms that include <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/07/23/chicago-would-stop-suspending-drivers-licenses-for-unpaid-tickets-and-reinstate-57000-under-lightfoots-reform-plan/"">ending the practice of taking people’s driver’s licenses&nbsp;</a>for nonmoving violations.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of low-hanging fruit that, I hope this conversation will launch a kind of listing of those things that can easily get done but will make a huge difference,&#8221; Lightfoot said. </p>

<p>Dan Lurie, the mayor&#8217;s policy director, said the city will work with residents to achieve their goals. Race and gender would be &#8220;front and center&#8221; in all of City Hall&#8217;s work towards eliminating poverty, he said. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">4-part poverty plan</h2>



<p>The city&#8217;s new poverty policy will have four key parts: </p>



<p>First, the city will work to reduce expenses for the city&#8217;s most vulnerable. That includes addressing the high cost of utilities for low-income residents that unevenly affects people of color, especially seniors, and investing more into transit-accessible affordable housing, </p>



<p>Second, City Hall will work to expand quality jobs and increase income levels of residents in the city. An <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-minimum-wage-approved-20191126-esp6g6do6nhzjfl7i7yphbfmrm-story.html"">already approved minimum wage increase to $15</a> by 2021 is also part of the plan. </p>



<p>Also on the agenda are fair workweek rules, support for home care workers who are overwhelmingly women of color, and building a green economy with career development for people who were formerly incarcerated.</p>



<p>Third, the city will work to end the racial health disparities in the city, like <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/01/23/29-small-west-side-businesses-get-big-grants-to-grow-and-help-shrink-the-death-gap/"">the&nbsp;16-year &#8220;death gap&#8221; between downtown and the West Side</a>, Lurie said. </p>



<p><strong>RELATED: <em><a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/01/23/29-small-west-side-businesses-get-big-grants-to-grow-and-help-shrink-the-death-gap/"">29 Small West Side Businesses Get Big Grants To Grow And Help Shrink The ‘Death Gap’</a></em></strong></p>



<p>These efforts will tackle infant and child mortality, include violence prevention strategies and expand community-based mental health treatment through the mayor&#8217;s $9.3 million Framework for Mental Health Equity, and address the disproportionate environmental health impacts of pollution on communities of color. </p>



<p>Fourth, the city will promote wealth building among individuals, families, and entire communities. Achieving this goal will require securing more access to consumer credit for low-income residents so they can pay for cars, homes, and higher education. </p>



<p>Lurie said the solutions outlined in the city&#8217;s policy framework are only a beginning, and more solutions will be developed as they engage with residents. </p>



<p>Michael McAfee, president of research institute <a href=""https://www.policylink.org/"">PolicyLink</a>, said nonprofits, social service organizations, and business owners in the room were poised to make real change with the city&#8217;s support. </p>



<p>But without widespread buy-in, the mayor&#8217;s efforts alone will not achieve the ambitious goal of ending poverty. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the right vision…will we let it devolve into mediocrity?&#8221; he asked. </p>



<p>McAfee said the mayor has &#8220;set the table&#8221; to have difficult conversations that were swept under the rug in the past, noting that Chicago has been apathetic in allowing devastating poverty to exist for decades. Any meaningful solution must openly address the legacy of racism that stripped economic opportunity from generations of Chicago residents, he said. </p>



<p>&#8220;We designed the world to deal with black folks,&#8221; he said about discriminatory systems like redlining and the war on drugs designed to target black people, but that also functioned as a poverty trap looming over people of color, immigrants and even middle-class white folks. &#8220;That&#8217;s how racism works. You start out trying to hurt a group, and you end up screwing yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>During a Q&amp;A with Darryl Holliday, editorial director of civic media lab <a href=""https://www.citybureau.org/"">City Bureau</a>, Lightfoot addressed concerns that the city is too cash-strapped to pay for a wide-reaching poverty agenda with a budget deficit crisis looming overhead. Lightfoot said lifting residents out of poverty is a matter of fiscal responsibility: by &#8220;making sure that we&#8217;re using investments in a smarter way we can get a real return on investment,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;We can walk and chew gum at the same time,&#8221; Lightfoot said. &#8220;Think about how much easier it will be to balance the budget if everybody is dealt into the economy, and everybody has an opportunity to have a good-paying job and we expand the tax base.&#8221;</p>



<p>But before any new policy is implemented or tax dollars are spent, the first major hurdle to clear is simply talking about poverty and owning up to the choices that left so many people economically vulnerable.&nbsp; </p>



<p>&#8220;We have already accomplished a tremendous amount by being here together today to say the p-word out loud, over and over again. To talk about race, talk about the way in which government has perpetuated, elongated, exacerbated the problem of poverty in the city,&#8221; Lightfoot said. &#8220;And my commitment to you, my commitment is that I am committed to doing things in a fundamentally different way to be your partner in this work.&#8221;</p>

<p>NORTH CENTER — Charlie Sullivan spent his life enjoying music and contributing to his community. Five years after his tragic death, his parents are working to continue his legacy.</p>



<p>The 23-year-old musician died from accidental fentanyl poisoning in 2020. His family founded the Charlie Sullivan Foundation for Music and Social Justice in his honor; for the past four years, they&#8217;ve organized the Chucky Ar La Fest, a concert that showcases new artists and raises money for groups that support young musicians.</p>



<p>This year&#8217;s festival is Saturday at Martyr&#8217;s, 3855 N. Lincoln Ave. The show will kick off about 5 p.m. and will feature nine performers. Tickets are $15 in advance and $20 at the door. They can be bought <a href=""https://martyrslive.com/4th-annual-chucky-ar-la-fest"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">here.</a></p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-honoring-charlie-s-memory"">Honoring Charlie&#8217;s Memory</h2>



<p>Charlie Sullivan grew up in North Center and attended Bell Elementary School and Jones College Prep.</p>



<p>While Sullivan started playing guitar when he was 10, he quickly gave it up to play baseball and didn&#8217;t pick it up again until he was at Jones, said his mother, Susan Sullivan.</p>



<p>At the time, there were a lot of young artists making music in Chicago, Susan Sullivan said. Chance the Rapper was a senior at Jones when Charlie Sullivan was a freshman, and some of the members of the band Twin Peaks went to Jones around the same time.</p>



<p>Charlie Sullivan and a few of his classmates formed a band called The Boxers and started playing shows around the city. Charlie Sullivan later started a band called Thy Neighbors and began releasing solo music under the name Chucky Ar Largh, an Americanized, phonetic spelling of the Irish phrase &#8220;tiocfaidh ár lá,&#8221; which means &#8220;our day will come,&#8221; Susan Sullivan said.</p>



<p>Charlie Sullivan was largely self-taught and could pick up music easily, said his sister, Rose Sullivan.</p>



<p>&#8220;He got so good at it that I would just say, ‘Oh, I love this new song,’ and he would say, &#8216;Oh, I’ll play it,&#8217; and he would just know how to do it,” she said.</p>



<p>Charlie Sullivan was also very involved in the community, protesting against the <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/01/25/controversial-west-side-cop-academy-opens-after-years-of-pushback-from-activists/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">controversial West Side police academy</a> that ultimately opened in 2023, working with AmeriCorps and the Boys and Girls Club and helping develop community gardens in Rogers Park. He was also working toward an urban planning degree.</p>



<p>“He packed more in his shorter life than a lot of people get to,” Susan Sullivan said. </p>



<p>Charlie Sullivan died just days before his 24th birthday and a few weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Susan Sullivan said it was hard to grieve during a time when public gatherings were so limited.</p>



<p>On what would have been Charlie Sullivan&#8217;s 25th birthday, his family invited over a few of his friends and started talking about organizing a concert to honor him.</p>



<p>The Sullivan family organized the first Chucky Ar La Fest that August and formed the Charlie Sullivan Foundation shortly after. The foundation has donated to the West Point School of Music and the group Guitars Over Guns. Students from Guitars Over Guns will perform at this year&#8217;s fest.</p>

<p>Susan Sullivan remembered the first time her son played at Martyr&#8217;s. It was one of the first times Charlie Sullivan, then 17, performed at a real venue, she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;When he got off the stage, he said, ‘Oh my God, we’re actually good!&#8217; because the sound was good and they sounded so much better than they did in their basement,&#8221; Susan Sullivan said. &#8220;It was this epiphany that &#8216;This is something I love and I’m actually good at it.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Susan Sullivan hopes the foundation can provide that same &#8220;aha&#8221; moment for other young musicians.</p>



<p>“Chicago is a great music market, but sometimes these kids hit a wall because they can’t afford another instrument or they can’t afford studio time, so they end up playing in people’s basements and then they never go anywhere and then they drift away,” said Brendan Sullivan, Charlie Sullivan&#8217;s dad.</p>



<p>Eventually, the foundation organizers hope to host regular all-ages music shows across the city and even an annual street fest, Susan Sullivan said. The nonprofit organized a concert at Navy Pier this summer.</p>

<p>CHICAGO —&nbsp;Chicago Public Schools plans to change its highly competitive selective enrollment school admissions to make the process more equitable for low-income students.</p>



<p>Under a recently unveiled proposal, the district could do away with its ranking system for the highly sought-after schools — a change it would roll out for&nbsp;the 2023-2024 academic year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The effort is meant to provide more opportunities for low-income students from under-resourced communities to enroll at the district’s selective enrollment elementary and high schools, which offer rigorous curriculums and are among the highest-ranked schools in the state and in some cases in the country.</p>



<p>“When we look at enrollment patterns at these schools, we see that communities with fewer resources are underrepresented,” CEO Pedro Martinez said in a video discussing the proposed changes.</p>



<p>Advocates have long called for changes to the selective enrollment process, arguing that it shuts out talented students whose families might lack the resources and know-how to navigate the high-stakes applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They say the pandemic has added pressure and uncertainty to an already intense — and sometimes demoralizing — process for students and their families. Some have argued the district must open up the process at a time when COVID’s disruption has only widened disparities based on race and family income.</p>



<p>About 30 percent of seats at selective enrollment schools are currently awarded strictly based on a student’s test scores and grades in seventh grade. Those seats have predominantly gone to affluent, white and Asian American students, even though Latino and Black students make up a majority of the district’s student body, according to the district.</p>



<p>Of those seats, the vast majority — about 85 percent of elementary schools and 73 percent of high schools — go to families in the more affluent tiers, the district said.<br>The remaining 70 percent of seats are divided among four socioeconomic tiers. The district factors in where in the city students live in addition to their academic achievement. Students from community areas with the lowest median family income, homeownership rates, and education levels get priority in admissions.</p>



<p>Chicago Public Schools has more than 15,700 students enrolled at selective enrollment high schools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the proposal, the district is asking for the board to reconsider the process and has recommended two options:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list""><li>Remove the 30 percent rank and distribute all seats equally among students in communities that fall into four socioeconomic tiers under the district’s system.</li><li>Continue the 30 percent seats for the highest-scoring students regardless of socioeconomic status, but steer more of the remaining seats to students from the most disadvantaged areas in the city.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>“With equity as a core value, our district feels strongly about adjusting this process,” said Sherly Chavarria, chief of teaching and learning, in the same video to parents.</p>



<p>CPS officials are seeking feedback from parents as they consider changes to the selection process. The district has created a website to gather feedback and provide additional information to parents, students, and teachers to determine how it moves forward, and whether to formally propose changes to the Board of Education.</p>



<p>“Improving the selective process for our selective enrollment schools is a big step forward toward helping every student reach their potential,” Martinez said in a video, “ ensuring that every CPS student in every neighborhood receives a world-class education and creating a more equitable district for all our families.”</p>

<p>LAKEVIEW — North Siders will march to Ald. Tom Tunney&#8217;s (44th) office Friday to demand his support for a democratically elected council to oversee the Chicago Police Department.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/295129828550304/"">&#8220;End North Side Racism&#8221; protest</a> begins 5 p.m. across from the 19th District police station, 850 W. Addison St. </p>



<p>The route has yet to be announced, but it will include a stop at Tunney&#8217;s office, 3223 N. Sheffield Ave., where protesters will call on him to back the <a href=""https://chicago.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4169358&amp;GUID=D06677DA-F7F0-4036-B525-F577D7A1E849&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=&amp;FullText=1"">Civilian Police Accountability Council</a>.</p>



<p>The proposed CPAC ordinance, which is sitting in City Council&#8217;s Public Safety Committee, has support of 19 aldermen. If Tunney were to back the ordinance, just six more aldermen would be needed for its approval.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the first step in achieving safety and accountability for our Black neighbors,&#8221; <a href=""https://www.endlakeviewracism.com/?fbclid=IwAR30DdjFsj3GrFNoCMDxDOp4SdSeGOi903ihXHydltnun_d3qL2diKtSqPg"">organizers</a> said on the event page.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Tunney&#8217;s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>The protest is one of two happening in the Lakeview neighborhood this weekend demanding support for CPAC. On Sunday, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/06/11/black-drag-performers-to-lead-march-for-change-sunday/"">Black drag performers will lead a march through Boystown</a> in support of Black Lives Matter. Passing the CPAC ordinance is among their demands.</p>

<p>WEST PULLMAN — A Far South Side marketplace providing a physical location and community for a growing number of Black vendors will continue operating through the end of the year, thanks to a new grant.</p>



<p>Five Black-owned small businesses have joined the <a href=""https://farsouthcdc.org/marketplace"">Far South CDC Marketplace</a>, 837 W. 115th St., where vendors have sold products <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/12/28/10-women-owned-businesses-open-at-new-far-south-side-pop-up-marketplace-a-dream-come-true/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">since it opened late last year.</a> </p>

<p>The Far South Community Development Corporation, the nonprofit behind the program, has extended it until Dec. 23 because of support from The Coleman Foundation, according to a press release.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The marketplace reopened with the new and returning vendors for a &#8220;soft launch&#8221; in July, Elizabeth Neukirch, a representative for the Far South CDC, said.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to continue our Far South CDC Marketplace program and provide an opportunity for these incredible South Side businesses to explore the market of a physical retail space while showcasing their goods and services,” Florence Hardy, the nonprofit&#8217;s chief of development and innovation, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Neighbors can shop designer clothes, accessories, household goods, natural beauty and skincare products, handmade wood carvings, aromatherapy candles, roasted coffee and more.</p>



<p>Jennifer Givens, owner and CEO of Aries Rising, sees it as an important step in the development of her lifestyle brand.</p>



<p>Givens started Aries Rising in 2020 after ending a long career in corporate America, she said. Givens began exploring art as a means of healing, learning how to paint and using resin to make customized journals from YouTube tutorials, she said,</p>



<p>“It was like I did everything that America told me to do. I checked off all the boxes, like when you got an advanced degree and all these certifications. I worked for the biggest Fortune 500 companies in our country,&#8221; Givens said. &#8220;And here I am in 2019 or 2020, and I don&#8217;t have a job, and so that was [how] art became therapy for me.”</p>



<p>Givens, who is from the south suburbs and has family in West Pullman, is focusing on marketing and “bold branding” in the marketplace, she said.</p>



<p>“You have to be very confident about what it is you do, why you do it, how you do it, and then how you&#8217;re going to serve the people,” she said. “So even with [these journals], I think about how am I going to fill a gap for my particular customer and then by doing that, I can keep creating things that I think that they will innately or intuitively like to gravitate towards, and then want to use right and then recommend to other people.”</p>



<p>Givens also sees the marketplace as a place where seasoned entrepreneurs and those just starting out can work together and rely on each other, she said. People in the space with more business experience, like Rita Townes, owner of Vessels of the Paut Neteru, have “poured into her” and provided support, Givens said.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img data-recalc-dims=""1"" loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""6000"" height=""4000"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_9079.jpg?resize=6000%2C4000&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-651645"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">At Vessels of the Paut Neteru, Far South CDC Marketplace vendor, people can buy a variety of African art, jewelry, figures and other items. <span class=""image-credit""><span class=""credit-label-wrapper"">Credit:</span> Maia McDonald/Block Club Chicago</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Townes, who long has been interested in African art and crafting, has sold her products at vendor events geared toward small businesses around the city for several years. Her new space selling handmade African objects, arts and crafts and Adinkra symbols is preparing Townes to have her own physical shop someday, she said.</p>



<p>“Opportunities like these don&#8217;t come along that easily, but this is a very unique and special opportunity, and I wish there were many more like this out there because it&#8217;s very, very needed, and it&#8217;s very important to have such opportunities for us as Black people,&#8221; Townes said.</p>



<p>Ameshia Odom, a Roseland native and owner of Belans Scrub Line Collection, which sells scrubs for health care and day care workers, said being at the market has given her business more structure and opportunities to network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;You get organized, basically, and you can have interviews,&#8221; Odom said. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically actually getting your business structured the right way, versus you&#8217;re just all over the place. &#8230; Because a lot of people have a business, but we don&#8217;t know how to actually have it structured or don&#8217;t have the funds.&#8221;</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img data-recalc-dims=""1"" loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""6000"" height=""4000"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/09/IMG_8930.jpg?resize=6000%2C4000&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-651641"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Roseland native Ameshia Odom is the owner of Belans Scrub Line Collection, which sells healthcare and daycare scrubs. <span class=""image-credit""><span class=""credit-label-wrapper"">Credit:</span> Maia McDonald/Block Club Chicago</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Givens believes she and other vendors can be part of strengthening the Far South Side’s business community.</p>



<p>“I just think being in a space like this, we work together, we advertise each other&#8217;s products, I&#8217;ve taken people&#8217;s products with me to pop-ups that they can&#8217;t come, and I put their things on the table,” Givens said. </p>



<p>“So it&#8217;s almost like you can&#8217;t do this without a community. There is no alone in a business, whether if we&#8217;re in an incubator or our own retail space. You have to have a community, you have to have a network and you have to have those people that you can rely on and trust.”</p>

<p>WRIGLEYVILLE — Former baseball skipper Joe Maddon — who led the Cubs to the 2016 championship that broke a 108-year drought — is sharing his musings on that season in a new memoir. </p>



<p>&#8220;The Book of Joe: Trying Not to Suck at Baseball &amp; Life&#8221; will be released Tuesday, according to a news release. It&#8217;s co-authored by Maddon and sportswriter Tom Verducci, who also wrote a book about the 2016 Cubs. </p>



<p>Maddon plans to return to the Chicago area for a book signing and meet-and-greet with fans 7 p.m. Nov. 16 at Anderson&#8217;s Bookshop, 5112 Main St., in suburban Downers Grove, said a spokesperson with his publisher. The book is now available for pre-order across online booksellers.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s partly a recount of Maddon&#8217;s nearly half-century in baseball and part-scripture of his philosophies on coaching and leadership, according to the news release. </p>



<p>Maddon — known for his thick-framed glasses and zen aura — made up his own mantras, such as &#8220;Do simple better&#8221; and &#8220;Try not to suck.&#8221; </p>



<p>The book will also detail &#8220;why the honeymoon with the Cubs did not last, and what it’s like to manage the modern player, including stars such as Shohei Ohtani, Mike Trout, Albert Pujols, Yu Darvish and Kris Bryant,&#8221; according to the news release. </p>



<p>Maddon is credited for two of the most memorable turnarounds in recent baseball history: taking the Tampa Bay Rays from the worst record in baseball to the World Series the next year in 2008 and helping the Cubs break the &#8220;Curse of the Billy Goat&#8221; in 2016. </p>



<p>Maddon, who last coached the Cubs in 2019 and was fired by the Los Angeles Angels in June, has not ruled out a return to the dugout, <a href=""https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rays/2022/08/20/fired-angels-manager-joe-maddon-having-a-blast-and-blasting-how-some-teams-are-run/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">saying in August he would be open</a> to an “absolutely correct” situation to manage again.</p>

<p>UPTOWN — Provisions Uptown will close at the end of the month as the bottle shop joins other small businesses struggling with a drop in retail sales. </p>



<p>Specializing in curated liquor, home goods and gifts, Provisions Uptown will close at 4812 N. Broadway after Jan. 31, management announced over the weekend. Rogers Park Provisions, the original location for the &#8220;<a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150708/rogers-park/bar-owners-hope-morph-former-armilla-into-one-stop-dinner-party-shop/"">one-stop dinner party</a>&#8221; business, will remain open, co-owner Erik Archambeault said. </p>



<p>Provisions Uptown is consolidating into the Rogers Park location at 6928 N. Glenwood Ave. as both businesses have faced a loss of roughly 30-40 percent of sales, Archambeault said. Keeping both stores was no longer viable, and the Rogers Park location allows for more business synergy with the neighboring Rogers Park Social, the bar co-owned by Archambeault and business partner William Meek. </p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been struggling for years,&#8221; Archambeault said. &#8220;Retail has been a challenge. We needed to make the right decision.&#8221;</p>



<p>Provisions Uptown is offering at least 25 percent off all its merchandise until closing.</p>

It took over the former space of Shake, Rattle and Read, a record and book store that <a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20151207/uptown/demise-of-shake-rattle-read-adaptation-of-ric-addy/"">closed in 2016 after 50 years in business</a>. </p>



<p>After <a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150812/rogers-park/rogers-park-provisions-giving-locals-sneak-peak-free-tequila-saturday/"">opening the Rogers Park location</a> and <a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150708/rogers-park/bar-owners-hope-morph-former-armilla-into-one-stop-dinner-party-shop/"">Rogers Park Social</a> in 2015, Provisions decided to expand to Uptown after hearing from the local business development group Uptown United, and because Archambeault had hung out in the Broadway and Lawrence Avenue corridor for years, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something the area needed,&#8221; Archambeault said. &#8220;It was great right off the bat. Then the pandemic hit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Like many small businesses, Provisions Uptown has faced declining sales post-pandemic as <a href=""http://blockclubchicago.org/2023/11/22/as-small-business-saturday-approaches-local-shop-owners-report-dwindling-sales-support-these-places-otherwise-they-wont-be-here-anymore/"">customers have further shifted their purchasing habits</a> towards online and big-box retailers at the expense of local mom-and-pops. The businesses launched e-commerce sites to try to catch online shoppers, but sales never fully rebounded. </p>



<p>The closing of the nearby Lawrence Red Line stop as part of the massive rebuild of the CTA tracks also hurt the business, Archambeault said. </p>



<p>No employees are being laid off as part of the closure, as all employees worked the Uptown and Rogers Park locations, the co-owner said. </p>



<p>Rogers Park Provisions stocks much of the same wines, beers and spirits as the Uptown business, albeit in a smaller setting.</p>



<p>&#8220;My big message to neighbors is to support small businesses,&#8221; Archambeault said. &#8220;Small businesses are struggling, and we unfortunately have to make these hard decisions.&#8221;</p>



<p>Provisions Uptown is open 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday, 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Friday-Saturday and noon-6 p.m. Sunday until its last day in business Jan. 31. </p>

645075,"
<p>CHICAGO — About 1,600 migrants will be moved out of Chicago police stations in the coming weeks and into &#8220;winterized base camps&#8221; with huge tents, according to a new report.</p>



<p>The move is part of a new plan to tackle Chicago&#8217;s migrant humanitarian crisis, <a href=""https://chicago.suntimes.com/fran-spielman-show/2023/9/7/23863501/migrant-crisis-immigration-chicago-police-stations-shelters-tents-camps-brandon-johnson"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Mayor Brandon Johnson told the Sun-Times&#8217; Fran Spielman</a>. But an alderman who heads the city&#8217;s immigrant rights committee said the base camps will &#8220;basically look like refugee camps.&#8221; </p>



<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;not the best look,&#8221; Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) said. “The bigger problem is we keep getting people arriving. The federal government has to step up.”</p>



<p>The tent structures could hold up to 1,000 migrants, but ideally house 500. Johnson told the Sun-Times his office has identified suitable locations across the city, but did not share any locations.</p>

<p>The administration didn&#8217;t offer any details on cost or how to pay for the tents. The plan to relocate asylum seekers also would involve providing meals, and recreational and educational programs instead of outsourcing to a private agency, according to the Sun-Times.</p>



<p>Johnson did not rule out budget cuts, tax increases or both in order to pay for the ongoing crisis, according to the Sun-Times, which is costing the city more than $30 million a month.</p>



<p>After four months in office, Johnson&#8217;s office has not articulated a plan to help shelter and care for more then 13,500 asylum seekers who have arrived in Chicago since August 2022.</p>

<p>There are nearly 2,000 migrants being housed in police stations and at O’Hare Airport, and 6,800 in 18 shelters across Chicago, officials <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/09/07/greektown-migrant-shelter-opening-delayed-a-week-as-neighbors-discuss-safety-plans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">said at a community meeting Wednesday.</a></p>



<p>Over months, Block Club Chicago has repeatedly asked the Mayor&#8217;s Office for details on the city&#8217;s longterm plan to address the migrant crisis but has not received substantiative responses. In an interview last month, Johnson pledged support to find suitable housing for migrants, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/21/mayor-brandon-johnson-promises-more-help-for-migrants-and-homeless-but-offers-few-specifics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">but offered few specifics and did not offer a timetable for moving people out of police stations.</a></p>



<p>Johnson&#8217;s office did not respond to questions Wednesday or Thursday about the plan. </p>

<p>Alderpeople will be briefed on the city&#8217;s updated plans Friday, said Vasquez, who chairs the City Council’s Committee on Immigrant and Refugee Rights.</p>



<p>The idea Vasquez has heard is for city officials to set up “base camps” citywide to help the hundreds of people overflowing at police stations as the temperatures drop, he said.</p>



<p>When Chicago&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/01/31/is-chicago-running-out-of-room-to-house-migrants-more-seek-help-from-police-stations-hospitals-as-shelters-fill-up/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">first started housing migrants in police stations</a>&nbsp;as emergency overflow shelters over the winter, officials expected it’d be a temporary solution<em>.</em> But nine months later, men, women and children are still sleeping on police station floors in&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/05/09/as-lightfoot-departs-a-woefully-unprepared-chicago-leaves-migrants-in-inhumane-conditions-for-weeks-with-no-plan-in-sight/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">what volunteers have called “inhumane” conditions.</a></p>



<p>As of last week, around 200 migrants were living at the Near West (12th) District Police Station, 1412 S. Blue Island Ave., their sleeping bags and belongings&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/cpd1617scanner/status/1695979408576667660?s=46&amp;t=ArEFTmc0hLQFHq2eVS6eLg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">covering nearly every inch of the station’s lobby.</a></p>



<p>Vasquez told Block Club that every police station is &#8220;basically overflowing with people at this point.”</p>



<p>“I just got a text message from the 20th District asking me about how they would get tents,” Vasquez said.</p>



<p>Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd) told Block Club that although she doesn&#8217;t know yet what Johnson&#8217;s plan is, she doesn&#8217;t think the tents are a permanent solution.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t think that the tents are meant to be a permanent thing. I think that we’re getting way more people than we are able to have in police stations, and now the city is trying to figure out what are the other places where we can start opening up for people,&#8221; Rodriguez-Sanchez said. &#8220;But the tents aren’t meant to be an actual solution.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">&#8216;I Think It&#8217;s The Best Of A Bad Situation&#8217;</h2>



<p>Sylvia Puente, co-chair of the Illinois Latino Agenda and CEO of the Latino Policy Forum, told Block Club the mayor&#8217;s office shared briefly this week officials would be announcing plans for a &#8220;tent camp.&#8221; The information was shared after the Illinois Latino Agenda had a meeting with Johnson to highlight &#8220;key priority issues for members,&#8221; Puente said.</p>



<p>The idea for the tents came after Johnson&#8217;s office viewed over 200 potential sites to house people, and very few of those options are working out, Puente said,</p>



<p>Puente said the administration assured her the tents are durable and will be heated. Migrants will also continue to receive meals there and children will be enrolled in schools, she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have over 1,000 people sleeping in police stations, including children. This crisis created opportunity and creativity. And what I appreciate is that the city is so being proactive &#8230; I think it&#8217;s the best of a bad situation because there is no good solution,&#8221; Puente said.</p>



<p>Eréndira Rendon, vice president of immigrant justice with the Resurrection Project, agreed. Migrants can&#8217;t continue to sleep at police stations, and the winterized tents could be a good temporary solution, Rendon said.</p>



<p>&#8220;If these are temporary tents that are winterized, that are adequate, that have enough bathroom and ideally privacy space &#8230; and they&#8217;re [used] very temporary for a few weeks while shelters are opened up. &#8230; It&#8217;s going to be better conditions than what we&#8217;re seeing at police stations,&#8221; Rendon said.</p>

<p>The wave of migrants began arriving in Chicago after&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/05/01/texas-will-start-bussing-migrants-to-chicago-again-monday-creating-humanitarian-crisis-lightfoot-says/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott</a>&nbsp;and other border state politicians bussed them to Democratic-led cities in protest of federal immigration laws starting in August 2022. Buses continue to arrive daily.</p>



<p>The majority of the arrivals are from Venezuela, which has struggled with political upheaval and an economic crisis resulting in severe food and medicine shortages, surging inflation, rising unemployment and violent crime.</p>



<p>More shelters are in the works.</p>



<p>City Council is poised to vote on a proposal <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/29/city-poised-to-buy-north-park-marines-building-to-turn-it-into-migrant-shelter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">to buy a former North Park marines building to convert it into a shelter that can house 500 people</a>.</p>



<p>The city&#8217;s 19th shelter is scheduled to open next week at the Parthenon Guest House in Greektown. It will house 196 migrants. </p>



<p>A 20th shelter will open in Fulton Market by the end of the month, according to Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th). The 50,000-square-foot office building&nbsp;at 344 N. Ogden Ave.&nbsp;could house several hundred people, Burnett said.</p>



<p>Asked Thursday night about the tents plan, Burnett, who also serves as vice mayor, said he had only heard rumors of Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;winterized base camps,&#8221; but hasn&#8217;t heard anything official from the administration yet.</p>

<p>Two weeks after taking office, Johnson convinced <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/05/31/city-council-approves-51-million-in-funding-to-support-migrants-after-dramatic-vote/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">City Council to approve $51 million</a> for staffing, food, transportation and legal services at temporary shelters. That money carried the city through June 30.</p>



<p>Despite running out of money, migrants are flown from San Antonio to Chicago daily, said Beatriz Ponce de León, deputy mayor for immigrant, migrant and refugee rights. One to three buses arrive every day, Ponce de León said at a community meeting Wednesday.</p>



<p>When asked what residents could do to help, Ponce de León suggested people should advocate for federal aid. </p>



<p>Johnson, Pritzker, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García and Sen. Dick Durbin are also pushing President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2023/august/JointLetterFromMayorBrandonJohnsonAndGovernorJBPritzkerStreamlineWorkAuthorization.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">amend federal immigration law to fast-track work authorizations for migrants as they wait for their asylum cases to be heard</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Immigration policy [and] resettlement efforts are a federal responsibility. We have been thrown in the midst of this, not just in Chicago but other cities, because Texas is putting people on buses,&#8221; Ponce de León said.</p>



<p>She also said other nearby towns have expressed interest in welcoming migrants, but did not specify which ones.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;We do have a handful of our neighbors that are also welcoming to immigrants and want to find a way to plug in,&#8221; Ponce de León said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s gonna look differently for each one depending on their capacity.&#8221;</p>

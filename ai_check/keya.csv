<p>PILSEN — A Pilsen-based nonprofit is launching an events space to host workshops, classes and other activities for young women in the area.</p>



<p>Camila Foundation supports young women ages 18-35 from Pilsen and Little Village through workshops and classes that will be held in its new space 1860 S. Blue Island Ave., said Executive Director Syd Rothman. She&#8217;s also creating a co-working corner in the studio that&#8217;s open to the neighborhood, and the center will host casual community events like movie nights.</p>



<p>Opening a dedicated event space in Pilsen was made possible by a grant from <a href=""https://www.amptchicago.org/visionmission"">AMPT, a funders group</a> that supports the development of Black- and Brown-led nonprofits on the South and West sides.</p>



<p>Rothman said she attended one of the group’s cohort sessions last year and was awarded a $10,000 grant&nbsp;to scale up her foundation’s work.&nbsp;The money helped her to find a space in Pilsen.</p>

<p>Rothman, a Chicago native who grew up in California, said she got her community organizing roots in Oakland. When she returned to the Southwest Side in 2018, she knew she wanted to create something to support women in her neighborhood, she said. She created the Camila Foundation in 2020.</p>



<p>The name and mission also came from Rothman experiencing a miscarriage several years ago and the desire to launch a group her daughter would&#8217;ve been able to benefit from as a young adult, she said.</p>



<p>During the pandemic, Rothman said she watched many women, especially women of color, still having to work in-person jobs every day because they were essential workers.</p>



<p>&#8220;I looked around and realized, you know, women are really the backbone of most communities, but I think that&#8217;s particularly true in communities of color,&#8221; Rothman said. &#8220;I really saw a need and wanted to fill that need to center and uplift Brown women and put them first in our community for once.&#8221; </p>



<p>Events at the Camila Foundation will center around one of four pillars: economic equity, education, community and civic engagement, Rothman said. </p>



<p>Some of the events include self-defense training for street vendors and informational sessions on work cooperatives, Rothman said. She&#8217;s held classes like these in the past in public settings, but she can now do so in a reliable and dedicated space, she said.</p>

<p>The workshops and classes are &#8220;tools&#8221; for women to build on long after they&#8217;ve attended the Camila Foundation event, Rothman said.</p>



<p>When Rothman first held a self-defense training, &#8220;you could tell everyone was a little nervous, a little bit shy about trying some of the moves,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But by the end, you could see it on their faces that they felt stronger.&#8221;</p>



<p>Self-advocacy is also important to Rothman&#8217;s mission, she said. She&#8217;ll bring in experts for know-your-rights seminars for things like tenant organizing, unionizing, navigating systems as a sexual assault survivor or even just basic tips for dealing with law enforcement, she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about our self-advocacy series because it feels like that&#8217;s a very direct embodiment of the goal of making people feel empowered and stronger,&#8221; she said.</p>

583293,"
<p>CHICAGO — A Chicago school was unable to feed all its students at one point last month — and other schools have also seen issues with their lunchrooms.</p>



<p>Rickey Harris, Whitney Young Magnet High School principal, said at an Oct. 19 local school council meeting that cafeteria staff were unable to feed all students one day because of an unforeseen staff shortage. Three out of the five cafeteria workers had unexpectedly called off, leaving two workers to prep and cook the school&#8217;s lunch with no backup, Harris said. </p>



<p>Because it was a rainy day, most students chose to eat a free lunch from the school cafeteria instead of leaving campus, Harris said. That and the shortage of workers overwhelmed the lunch system, he said. </p>



<p>Administration at Whitney Young were unable to step in since they found out about the problem after lunch periods were over, Harris said. </p>



<p>Harris did not say how many students missed out on lunch, but he said he was assured by Chicago Public Schools administrators the shortage would not happen again.</p>



<p>When a school is short-staffed, the district sends employees from a citywide pool. If no one is available to send, the operations teams or the food service managers provide on-site support to ensure meals are served, district officials said.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not known if the citywide pool was contacted to help with the one-day staff shortage at Whitney Young.</p>



<p>&#8220;Chicago Public Schools is committed to providing healthy, high-quality food to all students. Staffing has been a challenge amid a national labor shortage but CPS schools have continued to serve free and nutritious meals to students every school day. To mitigate the impact of this labor shortage, CPS continues to host monthly job fairs and are extending offers to qualified candidates daily,&#8221; a CPS spokesperson said in a statement.</p>



<p>Staffing and supply chain issues have plagued the district since last year, with lunchroom managers having <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/01/13/cps-lunchroom-workers-struggle-with-food-shortages-covid-19-fears-you-dont-know-how-stressful-it-is-to-come-to-work/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">to having to juggle last-minute menu swaps and COVID-19 concerns.</a></p>



<p>Multiple lunchroom workers told Block Club Chicago in January their schools struggled with keeping their shelves stocked and having an adequate amount of staff to prep and serve meals.</p>



<p>The district has 316 Nutrition Support Services vacancies affecting 236 schools, and many schools face additional staff shortages due to employees calling in sick, according to a CPS spokesperson.</p>



<p>Englewood&#8217;s Harvard School of Excellence has seen problems, too.</p>



<p>Kendra Snow attended the school in the early ‘90s, and now her children go there, she said. She joined the local school council this year and learned the lunchroom has struggled to keep up with students&#8217; needs, she said.</p>



<p>“My kids started taking their lunches to school this year. They say the food is disgusting, that it doesn’t taste right and that they run out of food three times a week,” said Snow. “So the lunchroom staff always winds up making whatever they have on hand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A former lunchroom manager who worked at the school for a decade before leaving last year said it wasn’t uncommon for them to run out of food. The staff wouldn’t realize what menu items they were missing until after the vendors delivered their orders. She said she wasn’t aware if the vendors knew they weren’t sending the full orders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What I used to do is have a backup: You had to have a bag of something so that you wouldn’t run out of food. You know how many kids you got coming in, so you always cook a little more,” said the anonymous staffer, who now works at another school. “We’d make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches just in case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lunchroom manager and two other employees were tasked with serving 346 students, which she said was a five-person job. Being spread that thin made the work even more difficult, especially when it came to ensuring every student had a meal, she said.</p>



<p>“For a lot of these kids, this is the only time they’ll have a meal. To not have what we needed was a struggle. I know the principal doesn’t have control over that, and I’m not even sure she knew,” she said.</p>



<p>Harvard Principal Aisha McCarthy did not respond to Block Club’s request for comment.</p>

645075,"
<p>CHICAGO — About 1,600 migrants will be moved out of Chicago police stations in the coming weeks and into &#8220;winterized base camps&#8221; with huge tents, according to a new report.</p>



<p>The move is part of a new plan to tackle Chicago&#8217;s migrant humanitarian crisis, <a href=""https://chicago.suntimes.com/fran-spielman-show/2023/9/7/23863501/migrant-crisis-immigration-chicago-police-stations-shelters-tents-camps-brandon-johnson"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Mayor Brandon Johnson told the Sun-Times&#8217; Fran Spielman</a>. But an alderman who heads the city&#8217;s immigrant rights committee said the base camps will &#8220;basically look like refugee camps.&#8221; </p>



<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;not the best look,&#8221; Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) said. “The bigger problem is we keep getting people arriving. The federal government has to step up.”</p>



<p>The tent structures could hold up to 1,000 migrants, but ideally house 500. Johnson told the Sun-Times his office has identified suitable locations across the city, but did not share any locations.</p>

<p>The administration didn&#8217;t offer any details on cost or how to pay for the tents. The plan to relocate asylum seekers also would involve providing meals, and recreational and educational programs instead of outsourcing to a private agency, according to the Sun-Times.</p>



<p>Johnson did not rule out budget cuts, tax increases or both in order to pay for the ongoing crisis, according to the Sun-Times, which is costing the city more than $30 million a month.</p>



<p>After four months in office, Johnson&#8217;s office has not articulated a plan to help shelter and care for more then 13,500 asylum seekers who have arrived in Chicago since August 2022.</p>

<p>There are nearly 2,000 migrants being housed in police stations and at O’Hare Airport, and 6,800 in 18 shelters across Chicago, officials <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/09/07/greektown-migrant-shelter-opening-delayed-a-week-as-neighbors-discuss-safety-plans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">said at a community meeting Wednesday.</a></p>



<p>Over months, Block Club Chicago has repeatedly asked the Mayor&#8217;s Office for details on the city&#8217;s longterm plan to address the migrant crisis but has not received substantiative responses. In an interview last month, Johnson pledged support to find suitable housing for migrants, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/21/mayor-brandon-johnson-promises-more-help-for-migrants-and-homeless-but-offers-few-specifics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">but offered few specifics and did not offer a timetable for moving people out of police stations.</a></p>



<p>Johnson&#8217;s office did not respond to questions Wednesday or Thursday about the plan. </p>

<p>Alderpeople will be briefed on the city&#8217;s updated plans Friday, said Vasquez, who chairs the City Council’s Committee on Immigrant and Refugee Rights.</p>



<p>The idea Vasquez has heard is for city officials to set up “base camps” citywide to help the hundreds of people overflowing at police stations as the temperatures drop, he said.</p>



<p>When Chicago&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/01/31/is-chicago-running-out-of-room-to-house-migrants-more-seek-help-from-police-stations-hospitals-as-shelters-fill-up/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">first started housing migrants in police stations</a>&nbsp;as emergency overflow shelters over the winter, officials expected it’d be a temporary solution<em>.</em> But nine months later, men, women and children are still sleeping on police station floors in&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/05/09/as-lightfoot-departs-a-woefully-unprepared-chicago-leaves-migrants-in-inhumane-conditions-for-weeks-with-no-plan-in-sight/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">what volunteers have called “inhumane” conditions.</a></p>



<p>As of last week, around 200 migrants were living at the Near West (12th) District Police Station, 1412 S. Blue Island Ave., their sleeping bags and belongings&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/cpd1617scanner/status/1695979408576667660?s=46&amp;t=ArEFTmc0hLQFHq2eVS6eLg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">covering nearly every inch of the station’s lobby.</a></p>



<p>Vasquez told Block Club that every police station is &#8220;basically overflowing with people at this point.”</p>



<p>“I just got a text message from the 20th District asking me about how they would get tents,” Vasquez said.</p>



<p>Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd) told Block Club that although she doesn&#8217;t know yet what Johnson&#8217;s plan is, she doesn&#8217;t think the tents are a permanent solution.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t think that the tents are meant to be a permanent thing. I think that we’re getting way more people than we are able to have in police stations, and now the city is trying to figure out what are the other places where we can start opening up for people,&#8221; Rodriguez-Sanchez said. &#8220;But the tents aren’t meant to be an actual solution.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">&#8216;I Think It&#8217;s The Best Of A Bad Situation&#8217;</h2>



<p>Sylvia Puente, co-chair of the Illinois Latino Agenda and CEO of the Latino Policy Forum, told Block Club the mayor&#8217;s office shared briefly this week officials would be announcing plans for a &#8220;tent camp.&#8221; The information was shared after the Illinois Latino Agenda had a meeting with Johnson to highlight &#8220;key priority issues for members,&#8221; Puente said.</p>



<p>The idea for the tents came after Johnson&#8217;s office viewed over 200 potential sites to house people, and very few of those options are working out, Puente said,</p>



<p>Puente said the administration assured her the tents are durable and will be heated. Migrants will also continue to receive meals there and children will be enrolled in schools, she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have over 1,000 people sleeping in police stations, including children. This crisis created opportunity and creativity. And what I appreciate is that the city is so being proactive &#8230; I think it&#8217;s the best of a bad situation because there is no good solution,&#8221; Puente said.</p>



<p>Eréndira Rendon, vice president of immigrant justice with the Resurrection Project, agreed. Migrants can&#8217;t continue to sleep at police stations, and the winterized tents could be a good temporary solution, Rendon said.</p>



<p>&#8220;If these are temporary tents that are winterized, that are adequate, that have enough bathroom and ideally privacy space &#8230; and they&#8217;re [used] very temporary for a few weeks while shelters are opened up. &#8230; It&#8217;s going to be better conditions than what we&#8217;re seeing at police stations,&#8221; Rendon said.</p>

<p>The wave of migrants began arriving in Chicago after&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/05/01/texas-will-start-bussing-migrants-to-chicago-again-monday-creating-humanitarian-crisis-lightfoot-says/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott</a>&nbsp;and other border state politicians bussed them to Democratic-led cities in protest of federal immigration laws starting in August 2022. Buses continue to arrive daily.</p>



<p>The majority of the arrivals are from Venezuela, which has struggled with political upheaval and an economic crisis resulting in severe food and medicine shortages, surging inflation, rising unemployment and violent crime.</p>



<p>More shelters are in the works.</p>



<p>City Council is poised to vote on a proposal <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/29/city-poised-to-buy-north-park-marines-building-to-turn-it-into-migrant-shelter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">to buy a former North Park marines building to convert it into a shelter that can house 500 people</a>.</p>



<p>The city&#8217;s 19th shelter is scheduled to open next week at the Parthenon Guest House in Greektown. It will house 196 migrants. </p>



<p>A 20th shelter will open in Fulton Market by the end of the month, according to Ald. Walter Burnett Jr. (27th). The 50,000-square-foot office building&nbsp;at 344 N. Ogden Ave.&nbsp;could house several hundred people, Burnett said.</p>



<p>Asked Thursday night about the tents plan, Burnett, who also serves as vice mayor, said he had only heard rumors of Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;winterized base camps,&#8221; but hasn&#8217;t heard anything official from the administration yet.</p>

<p>Two weeks after taking office, Johnson convinced <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/05/31/city-council-approves-51-million-in-funding-to-support-migrants-after-dramatic-vote/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">City Council to approve $51 million</a> for staffing, food, transportation and legal services at temporary shelters. That money carried the city through June 30.</p>



<p>Despite running out of money, migrants are flown from San Antonio to Chicago daily, said Beatriz Ponce de León, deputy mayor for immigrant, migrant and refugee rights. One to three buses arrive every day, Ponce de León said at a community meeting Wednesday.</p>



<p>When asked what residents could do to help, Ponce de León suggested people should advocate for federal aid. </p>



<p>Johnson, Pritzker, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García and Sen. Dick Durbin are also pushing President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2023/august/JointLetterFromMayorBrandonJohnsonAndGovernorJBPritzkerStreamlineWorkAuthorization.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">amend federal immigration law to fast-track work authorizations for migrants as they wait for their asylum cases to be heard</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Immigration policy [and] resettlement efforts are a federal responsibility. We have been thrown in the midst of this, not just in Chicago but other cities, because Texas is putting people on buses,&#8221; Ponce de León said.</p>



<p>She also said other nearby towns have expressed interest in welcoming migrants, but did not specify which ones.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;We do have a handful of our neighbors that are also welcoming to immigrants and want to find a way to plug in,&#8221; Ponce de León said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s gonna look differently for each one depending on their capacity.&#8221;</p>

<p>CHICAGO — Fiercely protective red-winged blackbirds have returned to Chicago.</p>



<p>Red-winged blackbirds — <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/05/11/heads-up-chicago-red-winged-blackbirds-are-divebombing-earlier-than-usual-this-year/"">known for divebombing people</a> who come too close to stepping on their nests — are back in the city early for the second straight year due to &#8220;unseasonably warm weather,&#8221; said Edward Warden, president of the Chicago Ornithological Society.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/01/24/chicagos-2024-cicadas-will-have-2-noisy-broods-converging-for-first-time-since-1803/"">emergence of cicadas this summer</a> also puts into play a rare “massive food source” for the blackbirds&nbsp;— which will only grow their numbers, Warden said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re likely to see them eating more cicadas than usual and, as a result of the extra food, see more babies survive to adulthood,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The blackbirds have been called <a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160321/lincoln-park/natures-a--------red-winged-blackbirds-known-swoop-down-on-humans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">“nature’s a&#8211;holes” by some</a>&nbsp;for swooping down and attacking unsuspecting people in preemptive bids to protect their nests.</p>



<p>Like many birders, Warden has been the victim of plenty &#8220;unpleasant bumps on the head,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>His advice: Wear hats this time of year.</p>



<p>&#8220;These birds pack a punch,&#8221; Warden said. &#8220;It feels like an apple falling on your head from under a tree. &#8230; But they&#8217;re not looking to get into a bare-knuckled fight with giant mammals. They&#8217;re just looking to scare us off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red-winged blackbirds are one of the country&#8217;s most common birds, migrating to Chicago from the South <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/01/13/bird-nerds-build-massive-antenna-in-big-marsh-park-to-track-birds-through-chicagos-ancient-flyway/"">on a well-trodden &#8220;ancient flyway</a>.&#8221; They start to &#8220;calm down&#8221; once they become empty-nesters, Warden said.</p>



<p>&#8220;They come here to establish a territory, find food available, raise their families and continue their species —&nbsp;just like the rest of us,&#8221; Warden said. &#8220;It&#8217;s only when human conflict comes in, the blackbirds become notorious.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some of the easily agitated blackbirds are likely to have already started nesting, with the birthing season running through the end of June, Warden said.</p>



<p>The blackbirds usually nest near bodies of water, including the lakefront. They can be found near the ground, hidden in tall grass along waterways across the city, Warden said. </p>



<p>The blackbirds often signal when they&#8217;re close with a loud whistling sound, he said.</p>



<p>Despite Warden&#8217;s run-ins with red-winged blackbirds, he thinks they get a bad rap.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just protective parents,&#8221; Warden said. &#8220;If you were in their situation, wouldn&#8217;t you do the same?&#8221; </p>

<p>LITTLE ITALY — The city&#8217;s Christopher Columbus statues have been repeatedly vandalized in recent weeks amid renewed calls the monuments should be torn down.</p>



<p>The Christopher Columbus statue in Little Italy’s Arrigo Park recently had the word “killer” sprayed on it, and someone dumped paint on it. In Grant Park, another Columbus statue was spray painted with the words “BLM” and &#8220;genocide.&#8221;</p>



<p>The statues have now been covered in plastic wrap to keep them from being damaged further.</p>



<p>It’s not the first time the statue in Little Italy was targeted. In <a href=""https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20171009/little-italy/columbus-statue-vandalized-charged-defaced-kyle-miskell/"">October 2017</a>, three men were seen defacing it with red paint. Now and in the past, police officers and community members have tried to protect the statues.</p>



<p>But some Chicagoans say the statues should be removed altogether because of Columbus&#8217; controversial history.</p>

<p>Columbus has long been touted as the man who &#8220;discovered&#8221; America on Oct. 12, 1492 — even though it was already populated. That&#8217;s made him a hero among some Italian Americans. But critics have noted Columbus didn’t discover America and his actions led to mass genocide and crimes, including rape and torture, against Indigenous people.</p>



<p>Fawn E. Pochel, education coordinator for the American Indian Center, said keeping the Columbus statues upholds a history of white supremacy.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re upholding white supremacy and settler colonialism as what&#8217;s important in our history, which is based off of the genocide of Native people and placement of Black people and the marginalization of anyone who doesn&#8217;t uphold that Christian ideology of what &#8216;whiteness&#8217; is here in the United States,” Pochel said.</p>



<p>A <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/mayor-lori-lightfoot-remove-christopher-columbus-statue-in-grant-park"">petition</a> started in early June calls for Mayor Lori Lightfoot to remove the statue in Grant Park. It&#8217;s gotten more than 1,200 signatures so far.</p>



<p>And Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd) hinted at plans to remove the statue and other &#8220;racist monuments in the city,&#8221; saying on Twitter she wanted to make a list of such monuments &#8220;for a possible ordinance.&#8221; The alderman&#8217;s office did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>&#8220;They all need to come down,&#8221; Rodriguez-Sanchez said in a separate tweet.</p>

<p>But Lightfoot said Thursday she <a href=""https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/lightfoot-doesnt-support-removing-chicagos-columbus-statues/2292422/"">opposes</a> removing the statutes because they can teach people about the history of the United States.</p>



<p>“I know that the issue of Columbus, Columbus Day is an issue of great discussion, but I think that the way in which we educate our young people in particular about the history is to educate them about the full history,&#8221; Lightfoot said during a press conference.</p>



<p>In February, Lightfoot also defended the city’s decision<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/02/28/lightfoot-wont-support-changing-columbus-day-to-indigenous-peoples-day-as-a-city-holiday/"" target=""_blank""> to keep celebrating Columbus Day instead of Indigenous Peoples Day</a>.</p>



<p>Lissa Druss, a spokeswoman from the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans, said there can be “healthy debates” about many historic figures in United States history.</p>



<p>“For Italian Americans, Christopher Columbus represents a lot of our culture and history that we&#8217;ve contributed to our great nation,” Druss said. “What is going on in our world right now, and especially with the attack on the statue and other statues, this is not just an Italian American issue. This is an issue of all ethnicities. We are stronger together than divided apart.</p>



<p>“Especially in Chicago, we are overwhelmingly proud of the relationships that Italian Americans have with other ethnicities.&#8221;</p>



<p>Druss said she hoped there can be “strong, healthy conversations” about history and how to move forward to celebrate “all ethnicities.”</p>



<p>Pochel said that the country should continue to learn about historical figures like Columbus, but that education should be done thoughtfully.</p>



<p>“I think we need to look at the narrative that we&#8217;re putting out. And the fact that we&#8217;re putting these men on literal pedestals saying, ‘This is our values’ — that perpetuates a dehumanizing process that disproportionately perpetuate violence against Black, Indigenous people of color and other marginalized groups,” she said.</p>

<p>MONTROSE HARBOR — As sure as the sun rises over the city of Chicago, Dan O’Conor is ditching his shirt and backflipping into its great lake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 57 years old and proud I can still do somewhat of a flip,&#8221; O’Conor said. &#8220;You breathe and jump.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>O&#8217;Conor has now taken the leap of faith into Lake Michigan every morning for five years. The ironman streak has attracted national media attention, brought out legendary musicians to serenade him on the ledge of Montrose Harbor&#8217;s concrete beach and turned the beer-bellied, concert-junkie father of three into the local man known as the &#8220;Great Lake Jumper.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The addictive plunge into Lake Michigan that started on June 13, 2020, as a hangover cure is what O&#8217;Conor now calls his best habit. He&#8217;s been seen out there <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/01/14/chicagos-great-lake-jumper-does-it-again-jumping-into-lake-michigan-despite-below-zero-temps/"">even when the lake has frozen over.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The white spots on the ledge right here are from me chipping away the ice with my shovel,&#8221; O&#8217;Conor said. &#8220;I was here the morning they repainted all the &#8216;Don&#8217;t Jump&#8217; signs.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Great Lake Jumper has become part of Chicago&#8217;s daily life. But if you ask him, it&#8217;s been more about finding an inner peace.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve become more accepting. It&#8217;s a big world out there, but there are not too many bummer days here,&#8221; said O&#8217;Conor, draped in a towel and looking out on the water after a Block Club reporter jumped in with him Monday morning. &#8220;The lake is a wonderful elixir. You jump in, there&#8217;s a renewal, an endorphin rush, blowing all the crap out of your system. It lights you up.&#8221;</p>



<p>O&#8217;Conor, smiling softly through chipped teeth and a handlebar mustache, claims to have no care really for his five-year streak. But he&#8217;ll host <a href=""https://x.com/TheRealDtox/status/1926341522607268276/photo/1"">his annual anniversary party</a> 10 a.m. Saturday around his jumping spot, 295 W. Montrose Harbor Drive, with live music, a popcorn machine and free reprieve in Lake Michigan&#8217;s chilly June waters.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Conor has kept the streak alive even when he&#8217;s been pulled away from Lake Michigan for family vacations, college visits and travel baseball trips with his three sons. He&#8217;s jumped in all five Great Lakes, the Fox River, Lake Geneva, the Potomac River, the three rivers of Pittsburgh and is 9,998 away from finishing Minnesota&#8217;s &#8220;Land of 10,000 Lakes.&#8221; His only injury is a bit of frostbite on one finger from climbing the ladder out of Montrose Harbor in the dead of winter. He has no plans of ever stopping. </p>



<p>He films the daily jump and posts it online for nonbelievers and concerned friends alike, dedicating each jump to an inspiration from Jimmy Buffett to Mavis Staples. Musicians like Jeff Tweedy and the late Steve Albini— who O&#8217;Conor said &#8220;loved pulled pork and was just like the rest of us&#8221; — have joined him at Montrose Harbor to strum a tune while he jumps.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never played an instrument, but with music, I love the immediacy of it. It&#8217;s right in front of you. And it&#8217;s either a yay or a nay,&#8221; said O&#8217;Conor, who sees live music almost every week and owns 1,200 records. &#8220;To find positivity in these modern times, it&#8217;s a blessing.&#8221; </p>

<p>Life is now brighter for O&#8217;Conor than when the pandemic lockdown canceled concerts and pulled him into a depression. He had lost his way in the music business and was driving a bus in the early mornings and a limousine into the night. He drank too much bourbon at one of his sons&#8217; high school graduation parties. It was the start of a wake-up call. Reeling in another bad hangover, he took his wife&#8217;s advice and biked to the lake. He jumped in. He held himself accountable to something new. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a better place,&#8221; O&#8217;Conor said. &#8220;A lot more people have been able to discover the lake in the last five years.&#8221; </p>



<p>He&#8217;s swapped bourbon for beer and found a community has blossomed around him on the concrete beach. There&#8217;s his friends <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/07/02/so-many-divvy-bikes-are-submerged-in-lake-michigan-that-theres-now-a-group-dedicated-to-fishing-them-out/"">who fish Divvy bikes out of the lake</a>, the local journalists who seem like they can&#8217;t get enough of him and a group of &#8220;mostly women&#8221; who like to go swimming near his spot. On Monday, O&#8217;Conor brought one of them a cinnamon crumble cake for her birthday.</p>



<p>&#8220;They asked me to join their WhatsApp group and I declined or whatever,&#8221; O&#8217;Conor said. &#8220;Because I&#8217;ll be coming out here regardless.&#8221; </p>

<p>Recently, O&#8217;Conor has been listening to Chicago rock band Horsegirl and British punk rock band Mclusky. He&#8217;s still glowing from seeing Grace Jones perform with Janelle Monáe at Ravinia. His summer plans include hearing a DJ collective at GMan Tavern and a trip to Cape Cod. He&#8217;s found steady work at a wine distribution company and <a href=""https://www.dtoxdesigns.com/"">sells spray painted t-shirts</a> every year at Lollapalooza.</p>



<p>O&#8217;Conor likes to bring a chair and cooler to his son&#8217;s travel baseball games, where he is more known as the guy who grills everyone chicken drumsticks than the Great Lake Jumper. </p>



<p>O&#8217;Conor lost his mother last year. He has a new way to deal with grief that she never fully understood. </p>



<p>&#8220;When you jump in the lake, especially in the winter, you just feel so alive,&#8221; O&#8217;Conor said. &#8220;Since the pandemic, we&#8217;ve lost so many people. That&#8217;s life. You can&#8217;t always take away the sting.&#8221;</p>



<p>A styrofoam cup tumbled past the concrete Monday as O&#8217;Conor looked across the water one more time before packing up his belongings to get to his day job.</p>



<p>His life has changed over five years. But why he jumps remains the same.</p>



<p>&#8220;The core reason of hitting the water, that wonderful feeling of splashing, it&#8217;s almost a child-like quality of exuberance,&#8221; O&#8217;Conor said. &#8220;You get out and try to hold on to that feeling until the next day.&#8221; </p>

<p>CHICAGO —&nbsp;Stephanie Meeks graduated high school in 2020 and wasn’t sure what would come next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, that summer, she got an email from her advisor at Carver Military Academy telling her about a program called <a href=""https://onemilliondegrees.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">One Million Degrees</a> that would help her academically, connect her with a career coach, and give her a $1,000 stipend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meeks applied and was accepted about a month later. Since then, her mentor and the staff at One Million Degrees have helped her with everything from term papers to bus fare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One Million Degrees helped me grow as a person – to get myself out of my shell,” Meeks said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now in her final semester at Olive-Harvey College, Meeks hopes to be a labor and delivery nurse or a marriage and family therapist and – thanks to One Million Degrees – she has a plan for how to get there.</p>



<p>The wraparound support provided to Meeks will now be provided to all of her peers at Olive-Harvey on the Far South Side. No application necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under a four-year, $20 million expansion announced today, all students taking at least nine credits at Olive-Harvey will be automatically enrolled in One Million Degrees, unless they say they don’t want to participate. The goal is to reach 3,000 students across multiple City College campuses by 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why should it be by chance or luck that somebody finds out about these support services?” said Aneesh Sohoni, CEO of One Million Degrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nonprofit launched in 2006 to provide low-income community college students with wraparound support to help them stay in school and complete their degrees. Students are paired with a mentor, provided tutoring, and given a $1,000 annual stipend. The organization’s former CEO Paige Ponder – now a member of the Chicago Board of Education – likened it to “<a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-one-million-degrees-paige-ponder-executive-qa-0410-biz-20160408-story.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">helicopter-parenting</a>” in a 2016 interview with the Chicago Tribune.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so far, it’s worked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only about a quarter of City Colleges students <a href=""https://www.ccc.edu/menu/pages/facts-and-statistics.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">earn a degree in three years</a>. But an <a href=""https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/attachments/89ba899bbb8d94545822ecffb39ae94f2c736345/store/466e7cde4a3f66a7c388d8f39c0ca80efc914f34b85caacb63509f4a4de2/Final_OMD+Working+paper_updated+June+2022.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ongoing study</a> by the University of Inclusive Economy Lab has found that students who participated in One Million Degrees were far more likely to finish a community college program and get a job or continue pursuing a four-year degree than students who were not part of the program. Researchers will continue to study the program through the next four years as it expands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>City Colleges of Chicago Chancellor Juan Salgado said expanding the number of students served by One Million Degrees is a key part of the community college system’s recruitment and retention efforts. This fall, the seven-campus system enrolled around <a href=""http://www2.iccb.org/iccb/wp-content/pdfs/reports/Fall_2022_Opening_Enrollment.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">35,000 students</a>, but only a portion are full-time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We want to invest in what works,” Salgado. “We want it to work for more students – dramatically more students.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sohoni said four new staff members known as program coordinators have been hired to work with Olive-Harvey’s degree-seeking students. Each coordinator works with about 65 students. The students will also be paired with a volunteer mentor or coach who can help them with everything from their course work to building their credit score to networking for their career.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s that extra human being that is assigned uniquely to you,” Salgado said. “That’s very meaningful to a young person.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salgado said that kind of mentoring is not something the City Colleges can do on its own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They can run around the whole city and recruit thousands and thousands of these mentors from the private sector and create the system for them to be matched with our students,” Salgado said. “That’s something that – at big public institutions like ours – would be hard to do.”</p>



<p>The four-year expansion effort will be funded with $5 million from City Colleges of Chicago, $5 million from the Pritzker Foundation, $1 million from One Million Degrees, and $9 million from other private philanthropy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Students at campuses other than Olive-Harvey can continue to apply to One Million Degrees and the roughly 900 students already participating will still have support.</p>



<p>Salgado said starting with Olive-Harvey is an “important statement” because the school is one of the furthest from the central business district and is a predominantly black institution. He said the leadership there is committed to the program and it’s a manageable place to start scaling the program since it is a smaller campus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We oftentimes celebrate these models that work and yet fail to take them to scale,” Salgado said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While there are no guarantees of success, I think we’ve positioned ourselves for success.”</p>

<p>CHICAGO — The city&#8217;s health department is urging Chicagoans to get their flu shots and COVID-19 vaccinations to keep people safe amid fears of a bad flu season.</p>



<p>The Chicago Department of Public Health kicked off its annual flu shot campaign Wednesday to encourage people to get vaccinated. Australia is having a bad flu season, which could mean Chicago will face a bad flu season in the fall and winter, health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said in a news release.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not the year to skip your flu vaccine,&#8221; Arwady said in the news release. &#8220;Getting your flu shot — in addition to being up-to-date with your COVID-19 vaccines — helps protect from serious illness as we enter the winter months.”</p>



<p>The health department recommends everyone 6 months and older get their flu shot before the end of October.</p>



<p>Health department officials are also urging people to make sure they&#8217;re up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. The city recently got the new bivalent vaccines, which provide people far great protection against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants that make up more than 99.9 percent of cases in the Chicago area.</p>



<p>Everyone 12 and older is eligible and encouraged to get the new bivalent booster shots. COVID-19 vaccination and booster shots remain free.</p>



<p>It is safe to get flu shots and COVID-19 shots at the same time, and it is encouraged to do so, according to the health department. Some people may experience flu-like symptoms and a sore arm for 48-72 hours after getting either of the shots.</p>



<p>People can get vaccinated at pharmacies — including those within grocery stores — and through health providers. Some people might also be eligible to get COVID-19 vaccination shots through the city&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/in-home-vaccination-program.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Protect Chicago at Home program</a>.</p>

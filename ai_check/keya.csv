<p>CHICAGO — At least five women have been groped recently in Lincoln Park, and one victim is warning her neighbors to be on the lookout. </p>



<p>Pauline Gebczak said she was groped in late April, the attack leaving her shocked and shaken up. She&#8217;s concerned the same man is behind  <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/06/06/men-grabbing-womens-genitals-assaulting-them-in-lincoln-park-police-say/"">four similar attacks in the neighborhood.</a></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s happening so many times. There&#8217;s clearly a problem,&#8221; Gebczak said. &#8220;I just want this guy to not be able to do this anymore to anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>At 9:50 p.m. on April 21, Gebczak was walking from a friend&#8217;s home at Armitage Avenue and Halsted Street to her own home down the street, a walk she&#8217;s taken &#8220;hundreds of times at various times of day,&#8221; she said. She felt safe on the walk because there&#8217;s a bar, River Shannon, along the route, meaning people always are in the area.</p>



<p>But as Gebczak, who was carrying several bags and speaking on the phone with her mom, approached the bar, she felt someone behind her. She looked back and saw a man who was &#8220;way too close,&#8221; making her think something was off, she said. Gebczak sped up and moved to the side of the sidewalk.</p>



<p>Then the man reached under Gebczak&#8217;s dress and grabbed her, she said.</p>



<p>Gebczak fell forward. The man laughed at her and then ran off, she said.</p>



<p>Gebczak went into River Shannon, where her friend met up with her and she called police.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t expecting that to happen ever, but especially not where it did,&#8221; Gebczak said. &#8220;I was on the phone with my mom &#8230; so she heard everything happen. That was the worst part because she was so helpless and didn&#8217;t know what was happening or how to help me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The investigators were &#8220;great&#8221; when talking to Gebczak, she said, asking many questions so they could understand what happened. They told her they&#8217;d drive around the area in hopes of seeing the man, who had fled west on Armitage Avenue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Obviously there&#8217;s little they can do. I didn&#8217;t get a good look at the guy,&#8221; Gebczak said.</p>



<p>Gebczak&#8217;s attacker was a man, possibly Hispanic, who was 25-35 years old and 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-8 in height, she said. He wore a black baseball cap, a gray hooded sweatshirt and gray pants with a dark-colored backpack.</p>



<p>No one was in custody and an investigation is ongoing in the incident, police said.</p>



<p>Gebczak said she&#8217;s been shaken up since the incident and has been taking Lyft or Uber in lieu of walking. She said she hopes women in the area will stay vigilant and consider taking rideshares or carrying pepper spray since the attacker is &#8220;obviously out and about.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gebczak reached out to Block Club because the attack on her and the man who did it seemed similar to four other attacks that have happened in Lincoln Park in recent weeks. It was not immediately clear if the attacks are linked to Gebczak&#8217;s assault.</p>



<p>During two of those attacks, a man walked up to women from behind while the women were alone and grabbed their genitals, then ran off, according to a Chicago Police community alert. In one instance, the man assaulted a woman who was with her friend and then got onto a bike and rode off.</p>



<p>The attacks occurred:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list""><li>11:30 p.m. May 17 in the 1900 block of North Cleveland Avenue</li><li>4 a.m. May 25 in the 2200 block of North Orchard Street</li><li>10:30 p.m. May 29 in the 1800 block of North Burling Street</li></ul>



<p>The attacker was described as a white Hispanic man who was in his mid-20s to mid-30s, 5-foot-5 to 5-foot-10 and 150-170 pounds, police said. He had dark hair and wore a white T-shirt and dark-colored pants or shorts.</p>



<p>In another community alert, police said a woman was walking at 1:45 a.m. May 24 near Sheffield and Fullerton avenues when a man came up to her from behind and touched her inappropriately. The man ran away afterward.</p>



<p>That man was described as being possibly Asian, in his mid-20s, 5-foot-10 and having black hair, police said. He wore a gray sweatshirt and black shorts.</p>



<p>Anyone with information about the attacks was asked to call police at 312-747-8380 or 312-744-8261.</p>

<p>THE RIVER — Hazy sunshine and an hour&#8217;s worth of green dye turned the Chicago River a vibrant, emerald green Saturday as Chicago kicked off the St. Patrick&#8217;s Day weekend with the annual tradition.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the 63rd year the local plumbers union turned the murky green river into a verdant vision — an effect that lasts for several days.</p>

<p>Thousands of people flocked Downtown Saturday morning to check out the process, lining the river from Columbus Drives far to end of the main branch.</p>



<p>After a night of rains and high winds, the weather cooperated, with the sun fighting through a haze and temperatures reaching into the 60s.</p>

<p>The river dyeing kicked off 10 a.m. Saturday, with Journeymen Plumbers Local Union 130 members dumping their proprietary blend of dyes into the river between Columbus Drive and Orleans Street. </p>

<p>The plumbers local has been behind the tradition since 1962. The effect became a symbol of the city that’s been well documented in tv shows, movies and your social media feeds for the next few days.</p>



<p>The idea was spawned by Stephen Bailey, who was the union’s business manager in the early ’60s and thought the dye — used to trace leaks in buildings — would be a nice way to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day.</p>



<p>Although the exact concoction remains a closely guarded secret, it is vegetable-based. Dyeing the river only requires about 40 pounds of powdered dye, which is spread from motorboats and shot into the river by hoses aboard Architecture Tours boats. Other boats follow behind to stir the pot and spread the dye. </p>

<p>WICKER PARK — Links Taproom, a Wicker Park bar known for having 36 different tap lines of craft beer, is closing down.</p>



<p>The bar at 1559 N. Milwaukee Ave. announced the news in a <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/linkstaproom/"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> post Thursday. </p>



<p>In the post, Links thanked the neighborhood for six years of business. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is not the end for us, it is simply a new beginning,&#8221; the post said. &#8220;Unfortunately, with the current situation, we cannot say for certain when or where we will see you again, but, rest assured, we&nbsp;WILL see you all again.&#8221; </p>

As of Friday morning the fundraiser had raised $4,181 toward its $10,000 goal. </p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the closures were the direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>



<p>The news was announced more than a month into Gov. JB Pritzker’s statewide restaurant and bar closure, which began in mid-March.</p>

<p>LINCOLN PARK — Rothy&#8217;s, which offers sustainable shoes and accessories, opened Thursday in Lincoln Park.</p>



<p>Located at 846 W. Armitage Ave., this is the first Rothy&#8217;s location in the Midwest, following other stores in Boston, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, according to a news release.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to bringing our dedicated, concierge-level shopping experience to the windy city,&#8221; Rothy&#8217;s CEO Stephen Hawthornthwaite said in the news release. &#8220;As one of our top markets, we&#8217;re excited to provide more ways to shop for our Chicago community by offering the ease and convenience of a physical location in additional to our online store.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rothy&#8217;s launched in 2016 and is known for transforming recycled materials into long-lasting shoes and accessories.</p>



<p>Like its merchandise, the new Rothy&#8217;s storefront is made from recycled materials, including plaster and ocean-bound plastic to create the floor, as well as a cash wrap and cabinets made from recycled wood fiber content and paper, according to the news release.</p>



<p>Giovanni Lepori, vice president of global retail development for Rothy&#8217;s, said in an email they chose to open the store in Lincoln Park because they thought it would fit in with the other businesses in the area.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our store is situated on tree-lined Armitage Avenue, nestled among world-class shopping, cafes, restaurants and parks,&#8221; Lepori said. &#8220;We fell in love with the residential character and local charm of Lincoln Park and are so happy to put down roots in such a vibrant neighborhood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rothy&#8217;s will be open 11 a.m.–6 p.m. Monday-Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.</p>

<p>AVONDALE — The wait is over: SmallBar is open to the public.</p>



<p>The dive bar at 2956 N. Albany Ave. opened in 2002 and <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/02/01/avondales-smallbar-gets-new-owners/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">closed temporarily in February when Footman Hospitality took over</a>. The new owners revamped the menu, upgraded the bar and fixed up the patio, Jason Freiman, Footman Hospitality founder and managing partner, previously said.</p>



<p>Freiman confirmed to Block Club the bar reopened Friday evening after a &#8220;practice&#8221; opening Thursday for friends and family.</p>



<p>The bar on the border of Logan Square and Avondale got a new Hamms sign out front and still has signature beers and ciders on tap, plus more cocktails, wine and other liquor options, according to the <a href=""https://www.theoriginalsmallbar.com/menu"">updated bar menu</a>.</p>



<p>Smash burgers, cheese curds, fries and grilled cheese are the only food options on the menu for now, but Freiman said the menu will get bigger.</p>



<p>&#8220;We wanted to start with a &#8216;smaller&#8217; focused food menu executed with excellence,&#8221; Freiman said. &#8220;We will expand the food offerings in the coming months when our kitchen partners, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/pattypleaser"">Patty Please</a>, are confident in the execution.&#8221;</p>



<p>SmallBar is open 4 p.m.-2 a.m. Monday-Friday, 2 p.m.-3 a.m. Saturdays and 2 p.m.-2 a.m. Sundays.</p>

<p>HYDE PARK — A group of soon-to-be seventh graders at William H. Ray Elementary School is anxiously waiting to see if City Council will pass their proposal to ban Styrofoam food containers in Chicago.</p>



<p style=""text-align:left"">The proposed ordinance, inspired by legislation in cities like New York and Seattle, would prohibit restaurants and street carts from using Styrofoam packaging.</p>



<p>As the sixth graders researched thermal energy and insulating materials this past school year, they came across &#8220;a ton of negative stuff&#8221; about Styrofoam, science teacher Vicki Drewa said. Drewa has run point for the students&#8217; initiative.</p>



<p>&#8220;They asked, &#8216;Why are we using this stuff if it&#8217;s bad for environment, if it&#8217;s bad for people?'&#8221; she said. &#8220;The only reason is it&#8217;s cheaper than everything else.&#8221;</p>



<p>The initiative didn&#8217;t start out with the intention of submitting a proposed ordinance, Drewa said. The students&#8217; first step was to call about 70 Hyde Park restaurants, asking what type of container they used.</p>



<p>Most hung up immediately or brushed off the kids&#8217; concerns, though about 30 took the time to talk with the students about how e<a href=""https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/2018/07/09/recycling-styrofoam-convenient-but-not-environmentally-friendly-mark-walter/760169002/"">nvironmentally unfriendly</a> Styrofoam is, Drewa said.</p>



<p>In <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/422692227/Ray-Elementary-Letter"">follow-up letters</a>, the students proposed the restaurants use compostable boxes as a more efficient alternative. Results of in-class experiments showed compostable boxes kept rice six Celsius degrees warmer than Styrofoam.</p>



<p>But their efforts didn&#8217;t go far; No restaurants responded to the November 2018 letters to say they&#8217;d make a switch, Drewa said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The kids were deflated at first, thinking, &#8216;Now what do we do? Does it make sense to contact other restaurants?'&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>In April, Illinois State Senator Robert Peters (D-Chicago), a Ray Elementary alumnus, visited the school. Peters told the students to send their ideas to his office, Drewa said.</p>



<p>The class sent 60 or 70 letters to Peters and other local elected officials and waited for a response. </p>



<p>With their efforts at a standstill, Drewa and school officials invited former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn to speak about how to &#8220;make things happen in democracy,&#8221; Quinn said.</p>



<p>He informed the students that the city code allows residents to submit ordinances to the City Clerk&#8217;s office for introduction to City Council.</p>



<p>Quinn&#8217;s guidance proved to be a turning point.</p>



<p>By June, an ordinance was <a href=""https://wbbm780.radio.com/styrofoam-ban-ordinance-ray-elementary-cps"">drafted and delivered</a> to City Hall. It was introduced to council and assigned to the Committee on Environmental Protection and Energy on July 24.</p>



<p>Committee chair Ald. George Cardenas (12th) said there is no exact timeline for a hearing on the proposal, although he said he will &#8220;try to slot it in&#8221; for mid-to-late October.</p>



<p>Cardenas &#8220;would love to have&#8221; a Styrofoam ban on the books in Chicago, he said. The restaurant industry shows signs of getting rid of the material on its own, but the city &#8220;needs to push them a little faster to make sure they&#8217;re on board.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bygone era of packaging that needs to go away,&#8221; Cardenas said.</p>



<p>The alderman said it&#8217;s &#8220;not frequent at all&#8221; that a citizen submits an ordinance to council; even less so for a group of children.</p>



<p>Yet student action has been influential in a few similar campaigns. <a href=""https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/cool-schools-2018/baltimore-teens-continue-lead-charge-against-plastic-pollution"">Baltimore City Public School</a> students fought for their <a href=""https://www.baltimoresustainability.org/baltimore-city-foam-ban/"">city&#8217;s ban</a>, while <a href=""https://buffalonews.com/2019/04/14/talk-of-styrofoam-ban-pits-environment-vs-cost-leaking-food-burned-hands/"">high schoolers have pressured</a> officials to do the same in Buffalo, N.Y.</p>



<p>As the students begin the new school year, they await the committee&#8217;s decision. Many of the students will return<strong> </strong>to Ray Elementary for seventh grade, but Drewa will no longer be their teacher.</p>



<p>Drewa credits Quinn for ignoring the students&#8217; ages and instead treating their concerns as seriously as he would any other citizen.</p>



<p>&#8220;When he came in and spoke, he wasn&#8217;t trying to patronize them,&#8221; Drewa said. &#8220;It helped the kids discover what it takes to get a law passed and be a part of history in a sense.&#8221;</p>



<p style=""text-align:left"">Yet the credit goes to the students, Quinn said, who are the first group of grammar school kids to propose a Chicago ordinance that he knows of. He is simply glad to have been a resource for them.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inspiring to see a great teacher and students come together,&#8221; Quinn said. &#8220;This is democracy in action.&#8221;</p>

632875,"
<p>LINCOLN PARK — Brian Comer has conceded in the 43rd Ward race to incumbent Ald. Timmy Knudsen, securing Knudsen&#8217;s first full term representing Lincoln Park and Old Town.</p>



<p>Comer called Knudsen on Tuesday to congratulate him on his victory, he told Block Club.</p>



<p>&#8220;I told him that this is my forever home, so my goal is to make sure that our community keeps getting better and I hope he can deliver on all his campaign promises,&#8221; Comer said. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to help our community move forward, and by extension, that means being of [assistance] to him as he leads our ward for the next four years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Initial election returns showed Knudsen leading a contentious race with 52 percent of the vote. Knudsen <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/04/04/timmy-knudsen-looks-set-to-win-in-lincoln-parks-43rd-ward/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">declared victory April 4</a> after all precincts reported results. Knudsen&#8217;s lead has grown slightly over the past week as mail-in ballots are counted, results show.</p>



<p>Comer will continue serving as president of the Sheffield Neighborhood Association, a founding member of the 43rd Ward Alliance and a police beat facilitator for the Near North (18th) District, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really proud of the election we ran,&#8221; Comer said. &#8220;And I love our neighbors and the 43rd Ward, so I just want to see the ship right itself, and I hope we can start doing that. But I&#8217;m here in the community, willing to help and heal.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a statement, Knudsen said Comer&#8217;s campaign raised &#8220;important issues&#8221; and he appreciates his perspective as a neighborhood group leader.</p>



<p>&#8220;After a spirited campaign, I vow to be a leader who bridges the gap, listens to all parts of our ward and unites our community,&#8221; Knudsen said. &#8220;We all share a common goal of making the 43rd Ward the best it could be, and I&#8221;ll seek to uplift that good within our community every single day.&#8221;</p>





<p>This will be Knudsen&#8217;s first full term as alderman since he was <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/09/21/timmy-knudsen-appointed-43rd-ward-alderman-filling-vacancy-left-by-michele-smiths-retirement/?fbclid=IwAR3Es8RS3wMMr-mTPT48_RStgVumQjl1SQuldn3Rhyinz8kDSTEz9shL7oY"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">appointed last year to replace the retiring Ald. Michele Smith&#8217;s</a>. He will be sworn in with the new City Council on May 15.</p>



<p>At 32, Knudsen is City Council’s youngest alderman. He’s also the first openly gay representative of the 43rd Ward.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Knudsen plans to continue focusing on public safety and work on policies focusing on environmental infrastructure like community composting and more electric vehicle charging accessibility.</p>



<p>Knudsen was a partner at Croke Fairchild Morgan &amp; Beres before becoming alderman.</p>



<p>Knudsen also founded the pro-bono practice at his law firm, which represents LGBTQ asylum seekers in Chicago and Tijuana, Mexico. He’s given legal services to more than 40 asylum seekers through this work, he said.</p>



<p>Citing public safety as one of the top issues affecting Chicago, Knudsen’s first move in office was to&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/09/22/freshly-appointed-ald-timmy-knudsen-to-install-security-cameras-across-ward-as-one-of-his-first-moves/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">reallocate his office’s menu dollars to fund more security cameras</a>&nbsp;and license plate readers across the ward.</p>



<p>Knudsen also plans to work with the new 18th and 19th district police councils to bring more officers back to the area, he said.</p>



<p>Knudsen has highlighted “fiscal responsibility” as his No. 2 focus in the ward, emphasizing that he supported the city’s latest budget, which “invests in our priorities like public safety and makes an advance pension payment — all without a property tax increase.”</p>



<p>To improve constituent services, Knudsen has started implementing technology that he hopes will help his office respond to 311 calls more efficiently.</p>



<p>With several City Council members leaving office, Knudsen said he sees an opportunity to build coalitions with other new alderpeople to bring a new approach to solving the city’s problems.</p>



<p>“My goal is to work together with new-housers who want to be pragmatic and get things done,” Knudsen previously said. “It’s been fun to do that with the other appointees and bring in an approach that is truly fresh.”</p>

<p>CHICAGO — Sixty-eight more people were reported to have died from coronavirus in Illinois during the past day.</p>



<p>New cases, positivity rates, hospitalizations and deaths are quickly rising across the state. Officials have said Chicago and Illinois are in the midst of a second wave of COVID-19, and people should wear masks, stop gathering and keep 6 feet apart to slow the virus&#8217;s spread.</p>



<p>Despite the virus, thousands of Chicagoans pulled on masks and headed to polling places Tuesday to vote in the general election. Officials urged everyone to wear masks. The Chicago Board of Elections said masks and hand sanitizer would be available for poll workers and voters, and people were asked to keep 6 feet apart in line.</p>



<p>Among the victims were seven people in Cook County, including two men in their 50s. At least 9,878 Illinoisans have been killed — and officials warned <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/10/26/illinois-on-pace-to-see-11000-people-die-from-coronavirus-by-end-of-2020-states-top-doctor-says/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the state could see 11,000 people dead by year&#8217;s end</a>.</p>



<p>The state also reported 6,516 confirmed cases, bringing the total up to 430,018 for Illinois.</p>



<p>The state’s seven-day positivity rate rose to 8.2 percent with 82,435 tests reported. It was at 8.1 percent Monday. The figure represents total confirmed cases divided by total tests.</p>



<p>Illinois is also now reporting its seven-day test positivity, which measures how many tests were positive out of total tests. It’s at 9.9 percent, up from 9.7 percent Monday.</p>



<p>As of Monday night, 3,594 people were hospitalized with coronavirus in Illinois, including 755 people in the ICU and 326 people using ventilators. Hospitalizations are up by more than 30 percent compared to this time last week.</p>



<p>In Chicago, two people have died and there have been 1,184 confirmed cases in the past day. There have been at least 3,084 deaths from COVID-19 in Chicago and 107,183 confirmed cases, according to state data.</p>



<p>The city is seeing an average of 943 cases being reported per day, a 17 percent uptick from the week prior. The city&#8217;s seven-day positivity rate has risen to 9.5 percent, up from 7.6 percent the week prior.</p>



<p>The city is also seeing an average of four deaths per day; for months, that number hadn’t risen above two or three per day. But officials have said deaths are beginning to rise in Chicago, and they’ll go higher as new cases and hospitalizations spike.</p>



<p>Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said the city is &#8220;keeping an eye&#8221; on the rising number of deaths. Hospitalizations have started to go up in the city, she said, which means deaths are expected to rise.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;really, really important&#8221; that people &#8220;double down&#8221; on things that can prevent spread of COVID-19, like wearing masks and social distancing, Arwady said during a Tuesday livestream.</p>

<p>DOWNTOWN — Scooters will return to Chicago’s streets this summer — but only as part of a second pilot program after city officials concluded that the first test run of the two-wheelers ended with “mixed results.”</p>



<p>Approximately 820,000 rides were taken during the pilot program that ran from June to October on the West and Northwest sides of the city, according to the final evaluation of the pilot program from the city and the Center for Neighborhood Technology. Ten companies scattered 250 dockless scooters across a roughly 50-square-mile area.</p>



<p>The e-scooter program holds promise, but additional review is needed to determine how to hold “vendors accountable, keep Chicagoans safe and improve citywide mobility,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday.</p>



<p>“While the initial pilot revealed mixed results, my team will continue to bring community members and all stakeholders to the table to identify improved guidelines and gauge if the scooter program is a viable long-term solution,” Lightfoot said.</p>



<p>Rosa Escareño, Business Affairs and Consumer Protection commissioner, said the second pilot program was needed because while the first test run “was successful,” “not everything was perfect.”</p>



<p>The second pilot will be designed with the help of community groups and transportation organizations to address a number of issues, including concerns about “equity,” Escareño said.</p>



<p>The 2020 pilot program will also focus on issues of sidewalk clutter and company compliance.</p>



<p>A majority of the 10 companies that participated in the 2019 pilot were cited by the city for violating the city’s rules, officials said.</p>



<p>Scooter advocates said they were hopeful the pilot program would give commuters an environmentally friendly option to reach buses, trains and Divvy bicycles.</p>



<p>But the results of the 2019 pilot were inconclusive on that central question, according to the evaluation.</p>



<p>Scooter ridership was concentrated in West Loop and along the CTA Blue Line, but it is unclear whether scooter trips supplemented train or bus trips. Approximately 34 percent of online survey respondents told officials they used scooters to go to or from public transit.</p>



<p>The city’s evaluation of the scooters also found:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list""><li>192 people were injured while riding scooters during the pilot program.</li><li>Most rides took place during the evening rush period on weekdays and between 3 and 4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.</li></ul>

<p>GRAND BOULEVARD — The storefront Abundance Bakery called home for over 30 years is now home to Pookie Crack Cakes.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. And whatever you&#8217;re thinking, owners Dedra McGee Simmons and husband Doug Simmons have probably heard it before. </p>



<p>But behind every name is a story, and the story of their bakery at 105 E. 47th St. is a great one. </p>



<p>Simply put, it&#8217;s a bundt cake with buttery glaze, McGee Simmons said.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know how the bundt cake fluffs up and cracks all at the top right, right? You poke holes in the cake before you pour the buttered rum sauce on it and let it drip all into cracks and holes of the cake. You soak it and then you turn it upside down and all that rum sauce and seeps out. You slice it and you and you eat it in the morning. It was really like a breakfast cake,&#8221; said McGee Simmons, who grew up on the West Side.</p>



<p>But the name didn&#8217;t really hit until a neighbor who sampled one of her cakes took note of the caravan of double-parked cars on their narrow residential street and joked that  McGee was putting a little something &#8220;extra&#8221; to be drawing such a large crowd. </p>



<p>&#8220;He said I had people out here like Pookie,&#8221; McGee Simmons recalled. The neighbor was referencing Chris Rock&#8217;s drug addict character in &#8220;New Jack City,&#8221; a popular urban &#8217;90s classic.</p>



<p>McGee Simmons said she&#8217;s seen people from all over the country stand in line to try her specialty loaf cakes. They come in nine varieties, including caramel, Chocolate Oreo Dream, Peach Crack Cobbler and her ever-popular Butter Pecan Praline. Each cake is $11.79.</p>

<p>What began as a modest side hustle to her corporate pharmaceutical job really took off during the pandemic, when — after spending several years selling her popular butter pecan praline cake out of her third floor South Shore walkup — McGee Simmons wondered out loud to her husband what would happen if she decided to do it full time. Besides, her cakes had become so popular their two-bedroom apartment was covered in cake supplies and McGee Simmons wasn&#8217;t sure when she&#8217;d be returning to the office.</p>



<p>It made sense to dream bigger, she said.</p>



<p>McGee Simmons made hundreds of cakes a week from her home, selling out of her inventory in a  matter of hours. She and her husband moved to a larger house, believing they&#8217;d be able to meet demands a little easier. When it became apparent they&#8217;d need even more space, her husband suggested they start looking in Bronzeville and Hyde Park — the two neighborhoods on McGee Simmons&#8217; wishlist.</p>



<p>The couple had just looked at a storefront in the nearby Rosenwald Apartments when they noticed the brown paper covering the windows of Abundance Bakery. </p>



<p>Simmons used to sweep floors there as a kid but lost touch with late owner Bill Ball as the years passed. That it sat empty now was, perhaps, a sign, Simmons thought.</p>



<p>He remembered how Abundance Bakery was a life preserver for so many kids like him, kids who&#8217;d been seen as &#8220;problems.&#8221; He remembered how Ball&#8217;s faith and support changed his life. </p>



<p>Ball, himself known for his caramel upside down cake, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/04/08/bill-ball-owner-of-abundance-bakery-in-bronzeville-dies-at-74/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">died in April 2022. He was 74</a>.</p>

<p>When Simmons began telling his wife about the history of his old neighborhood and how it created a lifetime of connections, she knew her bakery would feel right at home.</p>



<p>Simmons, a Marshall High alum, managed to beat out other 50 interested buyers last fall, getting the keys 24 hours after Ball&#8217;s widow returned them to the landlord.</p>



<p>McGee Simmons signed the lease in September 2022 and spent the last 10 months getting the storefront ready, investing $40,000 of her savings into the business. The night before the grand opening, the couple had $12.86 in their checking account.</p>



<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t even afford to get the peaches I needed for the cobbler cake. My mother-in-law had to go buy some for me and bring them down,&#8221; McGee Simmons said.</p>



<p>The bakery sold out of everything the next day and every day since, supply increasing with ever-growing demand. McGee Simmons said she&#8217;s gone from making 250 cakes a day to 400.</p>



<p>Traces of Ball and Abundance remain; a scale he once used to weigh items has been dyed pink and now serves as a cash register station. The strip of blue paint Ball once used to decorate the storefront is still there. </p>



<p>&#8220;The spirit of Abundance Bakery lives on in Pookie Crack Cakes,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;This neighborhood deserves a bakery.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pookie Crack Cakes is open 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday, and 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sundays or until they sell out.</p>

<p>CHICAGO — A 45-year-old man was shot and wounded late Wednesday in West Town, police said.</p>



<p>At 11:10 p.m., the man was walking in the 1500 block of West Huron Street when someone in a passing car shouted gang slogans at him and fired shots, police said.</p>



<p>The man was hit in his foot and he was taken to Stroger Hospital in good condition, police said.</p>



<p>The gunman was in a gray or silver SUV, police said. No description of the attacker was available.</p>



<p>No one was in custody and an investigation was ongoing.</p>

<p>WOODLAWN — Woodlawn residents want more of the city-owned lots designated for affordable housing near the Obama Presidential Center to be high density, ensuring a maximum number of lower-cost units and preventing displacement of longtime residents.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/09/09/city-council-approves-woodlawn-affordable-housing-ordinance-a-step-in-the-right-direction/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance passed in 2020</a> requires 30 percent of apartments built on 52 vacant, city-owned lots in the neighborhood to be made affordable to “very low-income households.” Of those 52 lots, at least 10 must be zoned for high density.</p>



<p>Residents with <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/tag/obama-cba-coalition/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the Obama CBA Coalition</a> want the requirement to go even further, with all available high-density lots on 63rd Street east of Cottage Grove set aside for affordable developments.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are asking for lots in areas of high density, where we could put more affordable housing &#8230; that would be closer to the Obama Center,&#8221; said coalition member Patricia Tatum, who has lived in Woodlawn for 34 years and worked in the community for 49. &#8220;Our voices should be the ones determining the future of this community, not outsiders.&#8221;</p>



<p>The coalition&#8217;s proposal would create up to 1,000 units of affordable housing in Woodlawn, CBA Coalition fellow Sahar Punjwani said. The coalition estimates that would allow about 3,000 residents to remain in the neighborhood.</p>



<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that we get those lots, as compared to the luxury developers who are also going to want those lots,&#8221; Punjwani said. &#8220;We&#8217;re making sure &#8230; the lots are not really spread across Woodlawn, as that would not lead to the same levels of affordable housing.&#8221;</p>

Lots in green are lower density, while lots in blue are higher density. <span class=""image-credit""><span class=""credit-label-wrapper"">Credit:</span> Provided</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>A proposal drafted by city officials in June would create about 390 affordable housing units on the 52 lots.</p>



<p>That includes 29 lots in low-density zones throughout the neighborhood, and 23 lots in high-density zones primarily along 63rd Street and Cottage Grove Avenue.</p>



<p>The city&#8217;s proposal is &#8220;advisory,&#8221; and housing officials are working with the Woodlawn Working Group and the planning department to meet the housing ordinance&#8217;s requirements, housing department spokesperson Eugenia Orr said.</p>



<p>Despite the city&#8217;s map, housing Commissioner Marisa Novara pushed back against calls to &#8220;pre-identify&#8221; locations for the 52 lots at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU9bnoA1S6s"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">a Dec. 15 working group meeting</a>. The <a href=""https://www.hpherald.com/evening_digest/city-activists-clash-over-implementing-woodlawn-housing-ordinance/article_cef857c8-6e7a-11ec-98e6-3bb4c9fd4a1c.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hyde Park Herald</a> first reported on the meeting.</p>



<p>Selecting the locations of the lots ahead of time &#8220;is not the same thing as identifying a funding source for them,&#8221; Novara said last month.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neither the city nor the state pre-determines at which addresses they will fund developments,&#8221; Orr said. The department &#8220;is&nbsp;thus&nbsp;not limiting developments to any particular address, rather committing to an open process for proposals as long as the affordability requirements are met.&#8221;</p>



<p>The first of the 52 affordable developments — <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/08/27/woodlawn-affordable-apartment-complex-can-help-curb-gentrification-near-obama-library-supporters-say-as-project-clears-hurdle/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the Park Station project</a> at 63rd Street and Maryland Avenue — was approved by City Council in September. The $30.8 million project will host 56 apartments, 41 of which are affordable.</p>



<p>Park Station is &#8220;an example of how we see [development of the 52 lots] working in action,&#8221; Novara said last month.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img data-recalc-dims=""1"" loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""2256"" height=""1270"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-13-at-10.42.31-AM.png?resize=2256%2C1270&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-492328"" /><figcaption>The city&#8217;s proposed map for Woodlawn&#8217;s 52 affordable housing developments would create about 390 units of affordable housing, officials said. Lots in light blue are zoned for low density, while those in dark blue are high-density. The ordinance in total would create about 532 affordable units under the proposal. <span class=""image-credit""><span class=""credit-label-wrapper"">Credit:</span> Provided</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s been a &#8220;tug of war&#8221; trying to get the city on board with the coalition&#8217;s proposal, said Marilyn Harper, a Woodlawn resident of 25 years. Harper, who has been active with the coalition for several years, said she never thought the fight to secure and implement the housing ordinance would take so long.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re optimistic, &#8230; but it&#8217;s going to take a lot of communication and working back and forth,&#8221; Harper said. &#8220;We still know it’s not going to come like magic.&#8221;</p>



<p>Harper lives in a building owned by her uncle. The family connection doesn&#8217;t protect her from the changing neighborhood market — her rent is rising, too, she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though you may be lucky to have an uncle, a relative, a father own the building … as much as they love you, they’ve got to survive like everybody else,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all the more reason to ensure the ordinance benefits renters and homeowners, said Tatum, who serves as president of the Vernon Village block club in the 6100 block of Vernon Avenue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right now, you have families where everybody in the family, two or three people are contributing just to pay the rent each month,&#8221; Tatum said. &#8220;If we get the housing [the city is] proposing, these people are going to have to move out of the community — a community that’s been their home for generations.&#8221;</p>

<p>As residents press for density among the 52 lots, city officials are rolling out other aspects of the Woodlawn housing ordinance.</p>



<p>Longtime homeowners in Woodlawn have until Feb. 15 to apply for grants of up to $20,000 to make exterior repairs.</p>



<p>Woodlawn residents who have lived in their one- to four-unit building for at least five years are eligible to apply. Applicants&#8217; households must make less than 120 percent of the <a href=""https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/renters/svcs/ami_chart.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">area median income</a>, which is $111,840 annually for a family of four.</p>

For help in applying for the grant, <a href=""https://bit.ly/homegrantinfo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">click here</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.cicchicago.com/woodlawn-construction-loan-fund/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Woodlawn Construction Loan Fund</a> for acquiring and rehabilitating vacant buildings, which launched in April, sits at $7 million and has closed on one property so far, Orr said.</p>



<p>The city loaned $5.4 million and issued about $37 million in tax-exempt bonds to rehab <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/07/06/woodlawns-island-terrace-apartments-affordable-housing-obama-library/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the Island Terrace Apartments</a> at 6430 S. Stony Island Ave., she said.</p>



<p><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.poah.org/"">Preservation of Affordable Housing</a>&nbsp;bought Island Terrace last summer. The nonprofit aims to make all 240 apartments affordable to renters making 30-80 percent of the area median income, or about $28,000-$75,000 for a four-person household.</p>



<p>City officials didn&#8217;t receive any multi-family rental development applications in Woodlawn during <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/12/15/chicago-is-investing-in-affordable-housing-in-bronzeville-near-south-side-heres-whats-coming/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the latest round of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits</a>, Orr said.</p>



<p>The housing department will start accepting applications early this year from&nbsp;developers seeking to build new homes on city-owned land, she said. </p>



<p>The homes will be developed under the <a href=""https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/developers/svcs/city-lots-for-working-families.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">City Lots for Working Families program</a>, and buyers of 20 of the new homes will receive purchase price assistance of up to $60,000.</p>

<p>LOGAN SQUARE — Neighbors who helped migrants at the Logan Square police station have pivoted to open a free store.</p>



<p><a href=""https://sites.google.com/view/14thdistrictvolunteernetwork"">El Árbol</a>, a mutual aid group born out of the Police Station Response Team of volunteers, now has a free store inside a church basement near the Shakespeare (14th) district station near California and Milwaukee avenues. Neighbors and migrants in need can access winter gear, personal hygiene kits, school supplies and more. </p>



<p>The store opened Wednesday with about 25 people coming by to take advantage of the free items, said Daniel Orkin, a lead volunteer and El Árbol organizer. </p>



<p>While it&#8217;s mostly geared for migrants, the store is open to anyone in the neighborhood who needs free winter items or personal items, Orkin said. </p>



<p>Interested shoppers can reach out to the mutual aid group <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/elarbolchicago/"">on Instagram</a> for the exact address, as the group doesn&#8217;t want to attract too much attention to the residential area, Orkin said. People can also email <a href=""mailto:14thdistrictnetwork@gmail.com"">14thdistrictnetwork@gmail.com</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;We got a ton of donations [and] a lot of really good stuff, and the key is to keep it organized and stocked with things that we need,&#8221; Orkin said.</p>



<p>The store is open Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and volunteers hope it can serve at least 30 families each day, Orkin said. Exact times will be shared to the group&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/elarbolchicago/"">social media</a>. </p>

<p>The church used to be the group&#8217;s space for collecting donations. When migrants were moved out of police stations at the end of the 2023, volunteers pivoted to a free store, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/12/05/logan-squares-the-parlor-is-helping-mutual-aid-groups-support-people-in-need/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">much like other mutual aid groups in the area have done</a>. </p>



<p>The store is inside a church basement near the police station and is always looking for volunteers to staff it during open hours. People can sign up online to <a href=""https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0B4FAFA92BABF8CE9-47345415-elarbol#/"">reserve a spot</a>. </p>



<p>The store&#8217;s details and guidelines are still being worked out, but organizers hope to continue to grow to formalize their outreach network and streamline ways to help migrants. The group plans to coordinate with churches also assisting migrants and work with <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/12/05/logan-squares-the-parlor-is-helping-mutual-aid-groups-support-people-in-need/"">The Parlor</a>, a free donation and distribution center built out of another Logan Square mutual aid collective. </p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try to do what we can in the short term, and as things come up, we can develop more processes,&#8221; Orkin said. &#8220;There could be a future where we&#8217;re transporting people from some of the neighborhood shelters at different times to restock.&#8221;</p>



<p>Store leaders also hope it can be a place to help migrant families who have found permanent housing get essentials like bedsheets, kitchenware and more, Orkin said. </p>



<p>&#8220;With the birth of this new free store, what&#8217;s nice about it is that it feels very proactive as opposed to the situation at the police station, which was very reactive,&#8221; Orkin said. </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hpsolidaritynetwork/"">Humboldt Park Solidarity Network</a>, another mutual aid group, operates a free store called Casa Hernandez, 3519 W. North Ave. The network collects donations through its <a href=""https://opencollective.com/hpsolidaritynetwork"">Open Collective page</a> to support the structure of Casa Hernandez and nearby aid models.</p>



<p>Donations to the network get disbursed to El Árbol, The Parlor, the Logan Square mutual aid group and others doing similar work in the community, said Nick Hernandez, Humboldt Park Solidarity Network lead volunteer. The money goes toward rent for some stores, infrastructure needs, shopping bags and other supplies.</p>



<p>The group is also accepting donations exclusively for <a href=""https://opencollective.com/hpsolidaritynetwork/projects/el-arbol"">El Árbol</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;If people are giving of their money during these tough times, we want to make sure if they ever ask about the situation, they can find all of the information on the open collective,&#8221; Hernandez said.</p>



<p>El Árbol&#8217;s free store is a way for volunteers and neighbors still wanting to help the new arrivals do their part and not feel burned out, Orkin said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The way I try to look at [volunteering] now is more about building community infrastructure and resilience &#8230; and how do we work better with other groups also doing this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;While we&#8217;re really trying to learn from them, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a situation where there&#8217;s a limit to the amount of people who we can support. It&#8217;s definitely a rising tide lifts all ships kind of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>PILSEN — A group of neighbors are calling for a Pilsen bar to be permanently <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/01/02/pilsen-bar-caminos-de-michoacan-temporarily-shut-down-after-shootout-outside-leaves-1-dead-2-wounded/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">shut down after a shootout</a> last week outside the bar left one man dead and two people wounded.</p>



<p>Caminos de Michoacan, 1659 W. Cullerton St., was temporarily shut down after three men were shot on the sidewalk outside the bar Dec. 30. Police Supt. Larry Snelling issued a summary closure order, which police use to close a business if they determine it poses a public safety threat.</p>



<p>At about 1:30 a.m. Dec. 30, two 32-year-old men and a 25-year-old man fired shots during an argument on the sidewalk in the 2000 block of South Paulina Avenue outside of Caminos de Michoacan, police said. The argument started inside the bar and moved outside, police said.</p>



<p>Neighbors are now calling for the permanent shutdown of the bar amid &#8220;increasing violence associated with the bar,&#8221; they wrote in an <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/shut-down-caminos-de-michoacan-bar-for-community-safety"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">online petition</a> dated Jan. 2. The petition had 78 signatures as of Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is absolutely crucial to shut down Caminos De Michoacan bar to bring back the peace and tranquility we so dearly miss,&#8221; the petition reads. &#8220;Enough lives have been lost, and it&#8217;s high time we put an end to this cycle of fear. Let us pledge to restore our neighborhood to its true state,&nbsp;where children can play fearlessly on weekends and neighbors can bond without worries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caminos de Michoacan is in a residential area near local schools and some small businesses, and neighbors are worried about safety in the area. It is a block south of elementary school Cooper Dual Language Academy, a block west of Saint Pius V School and two blocks south of Guadalupano Family Center, an early education center and day care.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want a safe place to live where kids can go outside at 9 or 10 p.m. without anybody being scared about a shooting,&#8221; said Oscar Gonzalez, a longtime neighbor and deacon at a local church. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s time to finally close this bar.&#8221;</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time neighbors have raised concerns related to the family-owned bar in recent years, several neighbors told Block Club. In 2019, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/02/11/man-charged-with-arson-after-officials-say-he-threw-molotov-cocktail-into-pilsen-bar/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">a man was charged after officials said he threw a Molotov cocktail at the bar.</a></p>



<p>Last May, a 27-year-old man was fatally shot and a woman was wounded in a <a href=""https://abc7chicago.com/man-shot-killed-1-other-injured-in-heart-of-chicago-shooting-on-18th-place-southwest-side-police-said/14768824/"">shooting in the 1700 block of West 18th Place</a>. The victims had left Caminos de Michoacan and were on their way to another bar, according to neighbors. Block Club could not verify neighbors&#8217; account.</p>



<p>Several neighbors told Block Club they feel unsafe leaving or returning to their homes late at night.</p>



<p>&#8220;It endangers innocent [people] who could get hit by a stray bullet,&#8221; said Christina Diaz, a longtime neighbor who lives near the bar. </p>



<p>Salvador Torres Jr., took over Caminos de Michoacan after his father, Salvador Torres, <a href=""https://www.hursen.com/obituary/salvador-torres"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">died in 2024</a>, neighbors said. Torres Jr. declined to comment Wednesday.</p>



<p>For many years, neighbors didn&#8217;t experience issues with the bar that attracted a local crowd in a &#8220;pretty calm&#8221; environment, they said. </p>



<p>But in the past five years, the atmosphere inside and outside Caminos de Michoacan has changed, some neighbors said. Performances and other events are hosted regularly, attracting large crowds and bringing people from outside the neighborhood, Gonzalez said.</p>



<p>The bar is often crowded on weekends, with long lines and groups of patrons gathering on the sidewalk. At times, people can be seen drinking on the sidewalk outside the bar, according to neighbors.</p>



<p>When Christina Diaz briefly visited the bar with family members about three years ago, security staff did not do a safety check, she said. She and her group left soon after as the environment didn&#8217;t feel safe and the bar was overcrowded, Diaz said.</p>



<p>Late-night traffic and parking are another issue as bar patrons take parking spots despite being in a permit-only area, neighbors said. Neighbors have also complained about patrons littering and urinating in alleys and sidewalks, and rowdiness and loud music coming from the bar, especially in the summer.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Bar owners] can&#8217;t blame patrons for being bad actors. That is not an excuse,&#8221; Curran said. </p>



<p>Last week&#8217;s shooting indicates the bar has not implemented adequate safety measures to keep patrons and neighbors safe as someone inside the bar had a gun, neighbors told Block Club.</p>



<p>&#8220;How do you explain that? Are the bouncers doing their job? Are they certified security guards?&#8221; Diaz said.</p>

<p>After the shooting, several neighbors emailed and called Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez&#8217;s (25th) office, Lucia Moya, the alderman&#8217;s chief of staff, previously said. </p>



<p>Torres Jr., the bar’s owner, is appealing the temporary shutdown, as he feels the bar followed its safety plan, Moya said.</p>



<p>Asked about increasing calls from neighbors to shut down the bar permanently, Moya said Sigcho-Lopez&#8217;s office will follow the city&#8217;s and police recommendations resulting from the ongoing investigation.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always followed their guidance, taking into account the concerns that neighbors share with us and ensuring that those concerns are addressed through that process,&#8221; Moya said. </p>



<p>The Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection received three complaints for the bar Dec. 30, which are under review, said spokesperson Elisa Sledzinska in an emailed statement.</p>



<p>On March 15, 2024, the city issued the bar a notice to correct after failing to provide proof of liquor liability insurance, Sledzinska said. </p>



<p>Since 2021, the city&#8217;s business affairs department has received six business complaints and two liquor establishment complaints about the bar, <a href=""https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests/v6vf-nfxy/explore/query/SELECT%0A%20%20%60sr_number%60%2C%0A%20%20%60sr_type%60%2C%0A%20%20%60sr_short_code%60%2C%0A%20%20%60created_department%60%2C%0A%20%20%60owner_department%60%2C%0A%20%20%60status%60%2C%0A%20%20%60origin%60%2C%0A%20%20%60created_date%60%2C%0A%20%20%60last_modified_date%60%2C%0A%20%20%60closed_date%60%2C%0A%20%20%60street_address%60%2C%0A%20%20%60city%60%2C%0A%20%20%60state%60%2C%0A%20%20%60zip_code%60%2C%0A%20%20%60street_number%60%2C%0A%20%20%60street_direction%60%2C%0A%20%20%60street_name%60%2C%0A%20%20%60street_type%60%2C%0A%20%20%60duplicate%60%2C%0A%20%20%60legacy_record%60%2C%0A%20%20%60legacy_sr_number%60%2C%0A%20%20%60parent_sr_number%60%2C%0A%20%20%60community_area%60%2C%0A%20%20%60ward%60%2C%0A%20%20%60electrical_district%60%2C%0A%20%20%60electricity_grid%60%2C%0A%20%20%60police_sector%60%2C%0A%20%20%60police_district%60%2C%0A%20%20%60police_beat%60%2C%0A%20%20%60precinct%60%2C%0A%20%20%60sanitation_division_days%60%2C%0A%20%20%60created_hour%60%2C%0A%20%20%60created_day_of_week%60%2C%0A%20%20%60created_month%60%2C%0A%20%20%60x_coordinate%60%2C%0A%20%20%60y_coordinate%60%2C%0A%20%20%60latitude%60%2C%0A%20%20%60longitude%60%2C%0A%20%20%60location%60%0AWHERE%20caseless_one_of%28%60street_address%60%2C%20%221659%20w%20cullerton%20st%22%29%0AORDER%20BY%20%60sr_number%60%20DESC%20NULL%20FIRST/page/filter"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">according to 311 records.</a> Five complaints, including one that was canceled, were submitted to the city&#8217;s Department of Public Health in the same period, records show.</p>



<p>Father Brendan Curran, an organizer at the Resurrection Project, said the bar should not reopen &#8220;without serious changes to its practices.&#8221; </p>



<p>Meanwhile, he and neighbors are urging others to report any incidents related to Caminos de Michoacan or other bars in the area.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you saw something, say something. Report it to the city,&#8221; Curran said. </p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to see someone out of business, but if they don&#8217;t want to comply with the rules of the neighborhood and protect the neighborhood itself, then we don&#8217;t want that type of business,&#8221; said neighbor Eric Diaz.</p>

<p><em>This coverage is made possible through a partnership between <a href=""https://www.wbez.org/environment/2025/03/18/a-chicago-church-wont-be-planting-fruit-trees-this-spring-as-climate-funds-remain-frozen"">WBEZ</a> and </em><a href=""http://grist.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em><u>Grist</u></em></a><em>, a nonprofit environmental media organization</em></p>



<p>NORTH LAWNDALE — Rev. Brian Sauder had good news in January for 58 faith-based organizations across the Midwest: His Chicago environmental nonprofit, <a href=""https://www.faithinplace.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>Faith in Place</u></a>, would be giving each of them a grant to fund tree planting in low-income communities and create urban forestry jobs to maintain them. Those additional trees would help mitigate the effects of climate change and air pollution.</p>



<p>But the good news didn’t last long.</p>



<p>On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed his&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>“Unleashing American Energy</u></a>” executive order, which abruptly froze the distribution of funds from the Biden administration’s sweeping climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. The move has left critical initiatives in limbo, including urban and community forestry programs like Sauder’s Faith in Place.</p>



<p>“To have to call up those grant awardees and say to them, ‘Hey, you need to stop work on this. We can’t reimburse you. There’s a lot of uncertainty right now,’ [it] was absolutely devastating,” said Sauder, whose organization has already had to lay off five employees as a result of the federal freeze.</p>



<p>The Inflation Reduction Act had pledged&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2023/04/12/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-funding-expand-access-trees-and-green-spaces"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>$1.5 billion</u></a>&nbsp;to plant more trees in cities and ensure their survival too. The funding, roughly&nbsp;<a href=""https://grist.org/cities/secret-solution-biden-climate-law-urban-trees/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>40 times</u></a>&nbsp;what the federal government typically had spent on urban forestry, promised to transform the urban environment across the country. Nonprofits and local governments staffed up to administer the historic level of funding and made big promises to poor and minority communities to help “green” their neighborhoods. Now, organizations like Faith in Place, still unable to access federal funds, are facing the financial fallout.</p>



<p>“We’re a microcosm of what’s happening all across the country, with these uncertainties and the government not keeping its commitment to these contracts,” Sauder said.</p>



<p>In response, Faith in Place has&nbsp;<a href=""https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1-butterbee-farm-v-usda-complaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>signed onto a lawsuit</u></a>&nbsp;spearheaded by Earthjustice, a nonprofit that litigates national environmental issues. The suit seeks to compel the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which distributes the funds, to honor its financial commitments.</p>



<p>“The president cannot come in and say, ‘We’re not doing that, we’re not following the law that Congress legislated.’ That’s a violation of separation of powers,” said Jill Tauber, vice president of litigation for climate and energy at Earthjustice.</p>



<p>The legal challenge comes as federal judges have ordered the government to release the Inflation Reduction Act funds already appropriated by Congress, but the USDA is still reviewing the Biden-era dollars. The freeze has stalled hundreds of urban forestry projects nationwide, including one to improve&nbsp;<a href=""https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04032025/portland-urban-tree-plans-federal-funds/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>Portland’s shrinking tree canopy</u></a>, an initiative to restore the more than&nbsp;<a href=""https://grist.org/cities/trump-stops-tree-replacement-new-orleans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>200,000 trees lost in New Orleans</u></a>&nbsp;in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.greenlatinos.org/our-causes/justicia-y-equidad-fund/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>plans to redress</u></a>&nbsp;the longstanding disparity in tree coverage across Chicago’s majority Black and Latino communities on the city’s South and West sides.</p>



<p>Faith in Place was set to receive its $1.9 million grant to increase tree cover in low-income communities and develop an urban forestry workforce. It then planned to distribute $1.6 million to dozens of faith-based organizations throughout Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.</p>



<p>Those plans are on hold. In a statement, the USDA said it was in the process of reviewing all grants, and while it had authorized some “mission critical” services to resume, it could not provide information on individual grants.</p>



<p>At the Stone Temple Baptist Church in Chicago’s North Lawndale neighborhood, the federal money was supposed to cover the cost of planting fruit trees in its community garden, providing the majority-Black community with seasonal access to pears, peaches, apples and plums.</p>



<p>“The goal was to get the trees in the ground this spring,” Sauder said. But that’s not happening amid the funding uncertainty.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-trees-are-key-to-mitigating-the-effects-of-climate-change"">Trees are key to mitigating the effects of climate change</h3>



<p>As cities like Chicago grapple with rising global temperatures, improving the urban canopy — the layer of collective tree cover in a city — isn’t just about beautifying the neighborhood. Trees help reduce air pollution and are increasingly among the most cost-effective ways to mitigate the impacts of climate change, according to Vivek Shandas, who researches climate change in cities at Portland State University and is a member of the National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council.</p>



<p>“Trees are there very quietly, providing essential ecosystem services,” Shandas said. “Every single day, they’re cleaning the air, they’re cooling the neighborhoods, they’re absorbing the rainwater and they’re doing all of these things for absolutely free.”</p>



<p>The problem: Chicago’s urban tree canopy is unevenly distributed across the city — often favoring whiter, wealthier neighborhoods — and it’s also shrinking due to disease and urban development. The city’s canopy cover dropped from 19% to 16% between 2010 and 2020, according to a&nbsp;<a href=""https://mortonarb.org/app/uploads/2021/05/2020-Chicago-Region-Tree-Census-Executive-Summary__FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><u>report</u></a>&nbsp;from The Morton Arboretum.</p>



<p>The hope was that the increased federal funding would transform Chicago’s urban canopy. The 58 grants that Faith in Place had planned to distribute included funds for 16 projects to plant and maintain approximately 280 trees across Chicago.</p>



<p>The funding freeze has also halted plans to plant trees statewide.</p>



<p>The Trump administration paused nearly $14 million in Inflation Reduction Act funding promised to the state of Illinois for projects that included hazard tree removal and pruning, tree plantings, tree inventories and other work related to tree canopy management in Illinois communities.</p>



<p>As the federal review drags on, the future of these projects remains uncertain.</p>



<p>“It’s really upsetting that the government’s not keeping their end of the bargain,” Sauder said. “We’ve kept our commitment, and they aren’t keeping their commitment to us.”</p>

<p>AUSTIN — A hospital campus shut down in the &#8217;80s may find new life as a community health hub for West Siders.</p>



<p>Some of the buildings that were once St. Anne&#8217;s Hospital are already in use by Bethel New Life, a senior housing and social service organization that bought the campus.</p>



<p>Bethel New Life is now working with other community organizations to turn the former hospital facilities into an urban farm and wellness hub. The buildings have been unused for decades and sit on the 9-acre campus at 1150 N. Lamon Ave.</p>



<p>The Mildred Wiley Wellness Hub would bring together health, food, career and education resources so people can have a place with &#8220;all the factors that are vital to helping people get to a thriving lifestyle,&#8221; said Sharif Walker, executive director of Bethel New Life.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built generations of families in low-income communities that have been in survival mode. But the American dream is really one of thriving families,&#8221; Walker said.</p>



<p>The need for wellness resources is demonstrated by the striking life expectancy gap between people living on the West Side versus those living Downtown, Walker said.</p>



<p>In parts of the West Side, residents are expected to live to an average age of 69 years old, according to a 2015 Virginia Commonwealth University report. The life expectancy of people living in The Loop is 16 years longer: 85.</p>



<p>The farm and wellness hub is a key project of the Austin Eats Initiative, a collaborative effort of local groups led by Austin Coming Together to create a neighborhood ecosystem where food and health resources are abundant.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just for survival,&#8221; said Ethan Ramsay, lead organizer for Austin Coming Together. &#8220;We want food to help build community wealth.&#8221;</p>



<p>The first phase of developing the hub would build an urban farm in partnership with the Chicago Botanic Garden&#8217;s Windy City Harvest program. Thirteen raised beds have already been built on the campus, which will allow residents to grow some of their own food and learn about healthy eating and horticultural practices, Walker said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re using that not only to work with young people … to start exploring horticulture and everything that&#8217;s needed to maintain a garden, but we&#8217;re also working with seniors,&#8221; Walker said.</p>



<p>Bethel New Life has 210 senior living units on the campus, so the garden has horticultural therapy programs to &#8220;give them the opportunity to exercise their minds while they exercise their bodies in the farm,&#8221; Walker said.</p>



<p>By bringing young people and neighborhood elders together, the farm also supports the emotional and relational health of the community, Ramsay said. Developing intergenerational relationships allows &#8220;youth to build community and have a safe space, and it&#8217;s very focused on food and agriculture,&#8221; Ramsay said.</p>



<p>A building once used for the former hospital&#8217;s laundry would become a horticulture center with a demonstration kitchen and classrooms to educate community members on wellness and healthy eating, Walker said.</p>



<p>The horticulture center will have youth programs to create a pipeline for young people to enter careers in health care, medicine and nutrition, Walker said. Bethel New Life is partnering with organizations to bring youth programs to create career pathways, like a nutrition program from the University of Illinois Extension, a STEM program from Project Exploration and after-school programs from I Care Ministries.</p>



<p>&#8220;If they have some of these pathways and understand what&#8217;s available to them, they have the ability to expand their careers in places that are going to help them sustain above a surviving wage job,&#8221; Walker said.</p>



<p>Bethel New Life plans to turn other vacant hospital buildings on the campus into a community café and fitness center. Walker envisions the Mildred Wiley Wellness Hub having an outdoor gathering space with a stage, a nature play garden for kids and a handicap-accessible walking path for exercise.</p>



<p>Bethel New Life is working with partners to organize a capital campaign to fund the planned wellness center. While raising money for the project, the group is building on some of the wellness programs already offered there, Walker said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are so many things you can do around food access and food education,&#8221; Ramsay said. &#8220;We want to keep building on those to be able to show people what we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>CHICAGO — Cook County Circuit Court Judge Kathleen Burke did not elaborate on her reasoning for invalidating the Bring Chicago Home referendum in a Friday ruling. In a court order received Monday by the Chicago Board of Elections, the defendant in the lawsuit against the referendum, Burke wrote that she ruled against the legality of the ballot question to raise the transfer tax on high-end property sales “for the reasons stated in open court and on the record.” </p>



<p>The court order confirms that the Bring Chicago Home referendum (<a href=""https://chicityclerkelms.chicago.gov/Matter/?matterId=4C434D15-6452-EE11-BE6E-001DD8097692"">R2023-0004166)</a>&nbsp;will remain on the primary election ballot but will not be countable or reportable unless an appeals court reverses the decision. The city filed a notice of appeal on Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is subject to change by future court order, so the votes for the question are being sequestered but will not be counted at this time,” Board of Elections spokesperson Max Bever said in a statement.</p>



<p>Bever also said the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners will itself “decide upon an appeal” on Tuesday.</p>



<p>On Monday, the city of Chicago filed a notice of appeal and asked the Appellate Court&nbsp;of Illinois for the First District to reverse Burke’s decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We applaud the city’s decision to appeal the judge’s ruling and remind our supporters that they can and should continue to vote YES on Ballot Question 1 while the appeal is underway,&#8221; Maxica<strong> </strong>Williams, chair of the End Homelessness Ballot Initiative Committee and Board President of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said in a statement. &#8220;Our campaign hit record numbers via doors, phones, and grassroots fundraising this weekend, mobilized by this blatant attempt at voter suppression by a handful of wealthy real estate interests. Together, we will continue to move closer to realizing our vision of getting Chicagoans out of the cold and into a home.&#8221;</p>



<p>The board is being sued by the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago (BOMA), Chicagoland Apartment Association, Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance, Women Construction Owners and Executives’ Chicago chapter, Southland Black Chamber of Commerce Foundation, Chicagoland Association of Shopping Center Owners and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following Burke’s ruling Friday, the city of Chicago, which is not a party to the lawsuit, filed a motion in circuit court to stay both the order invalidating the referendum and the denial of a request by the city to intervene in the case until appeals can play out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The city’s newly filed motion states that the ballot question is an “an advisory referendum that is part of the City’s legislative process,” since the referendum asks voters to give the city consent to make changes to the real estate transfer tax.</p>



<p>The question asks voters to OK a decrease of the real estate transfer tax to 0.6 percent for properties under $1 million, a rate hike to 2 percent for sales between $1 million and $1.5 million and a rate hike to 3 percent for property transfers above $1.5 million. The revenue “is to be used for the purpose of addressing homelessness, including providing permanent affordable housing and the services necessary to obtain and maintain permanent housing in the City of Chicago.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The city argues in its motion that it deserves to be a party to the lawsuit since it ultimately affects the city&#8217;s processes. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that only the Board of Elections can provide relief since it prints the ballots and administers elections.</p>



<p>“Chicago City Council has proposed amending its municipal ordinances on transfer tax and needs approval through referendum to do so,” the city writes. “The City not only has an interest in seeing its legislative process continue unimpeded but has an interest in protecting its citizens’ right to vote as part of the process required by law.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawsuit, filed against the Chicago Board of Elections in January, alleged that the city bundling a real estate transfer tax increase on high-end sales with a tax decrease on less expensive sales amounts to prohibited logrolling. The suit also argued that the ballot question is unconstitutional because it is not specific enough about how the revenue raised will be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, plaintiffs argued the referendum question violates the Illinois Constitution because it violates voters’ right to vote on each of the portions of the question separately.</p>



<p>Despite her order claiming the reasons were stated in court, Burke did not explain on Friday which of the plaintiffs’ arguments influenced her decisions and instead opted to read the motions from all parties for more than two hours.</p>

<p>CHICAGO — A 25-year-old man was wounded in a Sunday night shooting near the border of Logan Square and Humboldt Park.</p>



<p>At 9 p.m., the man was walking in the 3300 block of West North Avenue when three people attacked him, police said. One of the attackers took out a gun and it went off when the man tried to grab it.</p>



<p>The man was shot in his hand. He took himself to Community First Hospital, where he was in good condition, police said.</p>



<p>No one was in custody.</p>

<p>HUMBOLDT PARK — Nearly 30 Chicago chefs are coming together to help people affected by a humanitarian crisis in Tigray, Ethiopia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chicago chef Tigist Reda, a Tigray native, is hosting the Chicago Chefs for Tigray benefit dinner 6-9 p.m. Wednesday at National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture, 3015 W. Division St. Attendees can try dishes from the chefs, watch performances and shop from a marketplace, according to organizers.</p>



<p>Proceeds from ticket and merchandise sales will support humanitarian relief for women and children in Tigray and refugees in Sudan.</p>



<p>Tickets are $150 per person and can be bought <a href=""https://givebutter.com/EXKQu4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">online</a> or at the door. Guests are encouraged to dress casually.</p>



<p>The United Nations has said there&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/19/un-warring-sides-committing-atrocities-in-ethiopias-tigray"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">evidence war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> — including murders and sexual attacks — have been committed in Tigray amid a war that started in 2020.</p>



<p>A communications blackout and ethnic violence has caused Reda to lose contact with family members and friends, according to a news release.</p>



<p>“I haven&#8217;t spoken to my 68-year-old mom for over a year,” Reda said in the release. “During this time, I also learned my baby brother and his wife had a little girl, but only from a few pictures sent via WhatsApp from the besieged Tigray. Since phone and banking systems are shut down, there’s no way for me to get them help or inquire about their safety firsthand.”</p>



<p>The event, held in partnership with nonprofit <a href=""https://hpn4tigray.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Health Professionals Network for Tigray</a>, is organized by the same team that set up&nbsp;Chicago Chefs for Ukraine, as well as Jodi Fyfe of the Paramount Group, according to organizers.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON PARK — A new nonprofit with an anti-racist focus has opened a community center on 51st Street, aiming to provide resources and mentorship to the South Side&#8217;s Black community.</p>



<p>The Barbara Murphy Community Resource Center, 239 E. 51st St., opened Friday. The center will have weekly giveaways of groceries, food and essential supplies in addition to community-focused programs, said Romel Murphy, founder of the nonprofit <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://equalityshouldbenormal.com/"" target=""_blank"">Equality Should Be Normal</a>. </p>



<p>The facility is named for Romel Murphy&#8217;s mother, who died of colon cancer at 46.</p>



<p>The nonprofit will hand out 150 hot meals Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays through a partnership with World Central Kitchen and West Loop restaurant Girl and the Goat. Chef Stephanie Izard serves as the nonprofit&#8217;s board chair.</p>



<p>&#8220;The South Side is getting food from one of the top restaurants in Chicago,&#8221; Murphy said.</p>



<p>Produce, bread, milk, eggs, pasta sauce, noodles and other &#8220;essentials to have a nice, balanced meal throughout the week&#8221; also will be given away Wednesdays through a partnership with Mariano&#8217;s, Murphy said.</p>



<p>The hot meal and grocery distributions begin 1 p.m. on their respective days and are first come, first served.</p>



<p>Giveaways of clothing, personal protective equipment, baby formula, diapers, toiletries and other essential goods will be held 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday-Friday. </p>

<p>Staffers at the center gave away about 100 pairs of socks, gloves and scarves, and dozens of feminine hygiene products and deodorant sticks on opening day Nov. 27, Murphy said.</p>



<p>Beyond the food giveaways, programs are being offered to support neighbors in need.</p>



<p>The initial slate includes Makeover Mondays, when there will be free haircuts and barbershop services on an appointment-only basis due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p>On Wellness Wednesdays, participants can receive free 30-minute remote therapy sessions 10 a.m.-6 p.m., offered by Homewood- and Hyde Park-based <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.mindsempowered.org/"" target=""_blank"">Minds Empowered Counseling</a>.</p>



<p>Minds Empowered is a Black woman-owned practice specializing in trauma, substance abuse and couples and family therapy — but people can call in for Wellness Wednesdays with any mental health concerns, big or small.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whenever any person desires that they need someone to speak to, [Minds Empowered will] cover it, regardless of the level of trauma,&#8221; publicist Laura Miller said. &#8220;It could even be, &#8216;I hate COVID and want somebody to talk to.'&#8221; </p>



<p>Twelve therapists are available as needed Wednesdays. The counseling service has also opened an office at the community center, and co-founder Kres Snyder serves on the nonprofit&#8217;s board.</p>

<p>Equality Should Be Normal was founded this year on <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/11/25/chicago-makes-juneteenth-day-of-observance-but-activists-continue-to-seek-official-city-holiday-status/"" data-type=""post"" data-id=""368291"" target=""_blank"">Juneteenth</a>, the holiday commemorating the freeing of Black slaves in the United States in 1865.</p>



<p>In July, the nonprofit organized the <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/319885689021071/?active_tab=discussion"" target=""_blank"">Make A Difference</a> weekend of service, conversation and food distribution, and last week staffers helped pass out more than 1,000 meals to residents of Parkway Gardens in Woodlawn.</p>



<p>The center is operating largely through partnerships with corporate donors for now, but Murphy said he wants to partner with other community groups and eventually shift to a mutual aid model as more residents learn about the programs available and get involved.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t want to get in any political relationships,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;I don’t play the politics game, and I don’t want to get in partnership with organizations that aren’t trying to make a true impact in the community. We need real organizations making real change.&#8221;</p>

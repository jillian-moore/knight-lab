<p>DOWNTOWN — Another activist group is suing the city for being denied protest permits during this summer&#8217;s Democratic National Convention, saying in a lawsuit the city is interfering with protesters&#8217; rights to march near the convention.</p>



<p>Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws is the second coalition to sue the city over denied permits to protest outside the DNC, according to a federal lawsuit filed Thursday.</p>



<p>The coalition alleges that its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights are being violated after the city denied its permit application to protest along Michigan Avenue the day before the DNC, which will take place Aug. 19-22.</p>



<p>Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws joins three other groups who have filed suit against the city, accusing the city of seeking to stifle their constitutionally protected right to protest and giving police too broad of powers to crack down on protesters.</p>



<p>The coalition&#8217;s original route would have started at 6 p.m. Aug. 18 at Water Tower Park. From there, protesters would travel south on Michigan Avenue, west on Wacker Drive, south on State Street, east on Adams Street and south on Michigan Avenue, ending at 901 S. Michigan Ave.</p>



<p>After initial feedback from the Chicago Police Department, Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws amended their route to include less time on Michigan Avenue north of the Chicago River, according to court documents.</p>

<p>The city denied the amended route and offered an alternative route, which started at the southern end of Grant Park, at the corner of Columbus Drive and Roosevelt Road, before ending at Columbus Drive and Jackson Boulevard.</p>



<p>Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws rejected the alternative route as it was not within sight and sound of their intended audience: the DNC delegates staying at hotels along Michigan Avenue, organizers said at a press conference Thursday.</p>



<p>The group intends to protest in support of protecting and strengthening abortion laws and bodily autonomy.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were the first group to apply for a permit. We gave the city more than eight months&#8217; notice of our plans. But we got a rubber-stamp rejection, which was copied virtually word-for-word on all of the subsequent rejections received by groups that followed us,&#8221; Andy Thayer, an organizer with Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws, said Thursday.</p>

<p>The city subsequently issued the same permit denials to three other groups: the Anti-War Committee Chicago, Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and Students for a Democratic Society.</p>



<p>All three groups applied to demonstrate during the convention and outlined different planned routes near the United Center, the main convention site. The city denied their applications, giving each group the same alternative parade route as it gave Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws.</p>



<p>Under the name March on the DNC Coalition, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/03/25/social-justice-groups-sue-city-over-denial-to-march-at-democratic-national-convention/"">the three social justice groups filed a joint federal lawsuit against the city in March, citing violations of the First Amendment.</a></p>



<p>The city told the groups their permits were denied because the Chicago Police Department lacked the number of officers needed for the DNC and the protests, according to the denied permit applications.</p>



<p><a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/03/19/social-justice-groups-appeal-citys-decision-to-block-democratic-national-convention-protests/"">When asked during an administrative appeal hearing in March</a>, Officer Gabriella Shemash, deputy chief of police area 3, testified that the alternative protest route proposed by the city would require significantly fewer officers and would not block a major emergency vehicle route to the Illinois Medical District.</p>



<p>Shemash, however, could not say how many officers would be required for either of the protest routes.</p>

<p>Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws said the same vague answers were given to them during the group&#8217;s administrative appeal hearing in January, according to the lawsuit. </p>



<p>Unsatisfied with the city&#8217;s response, the coalition filed its federal lawsuit Thursday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rather than make room for speech, Chicago has denied our clients and others permits to march where delegates can see them. These permit denials are unconstitutional,&#8221; said Rebecca Glenberg, senior supervising attorney at the ACLU of Illinois.</p>



<p>The Mayor&#8217;s Office declined to comment on the lawsuit, referring questions to the Department of Law.</p>



<p>&#8220;The City has not been served with the complaint and does not comment on pending litigation,&#8221; Kristen Cabanan, a spokesperson from the law department, said in an email.</p>



<p>Representatives from the Secret Service, FBI, Chicago Police Department, Chicago’s Office of Emergency Management and the Chicago 2024 Host Committee have already started <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/04/09/secret-service-meets-with-south-loop-businesses-about-dncs-security-impact/"">canvassing the areas around the United Center and McCormick Place, </a>where the convention will be held.</p>



<p>The DNC is considered a “national special security event,” which means the Secret Service will be in charge of safety inside the designated footprint of the convention at the United Center and McCormick Place. Chicago police will be in charge of safety outside the footprint.</p>



<p>Last month, the Secret Service released tentative maps showing the areas around the United Center and McCormick Place that could be affected by the security footprint. The final footprint will be released in July, officials said.</p>

<p>On April 17, City Council <a href=""https://occprodstoragev1.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/matterattachmentspublic/b72e139b-6f6b-474e-971c-1c526f7f3ad6.pdf"">passed an ordinance introduced by</a> Mayor Brandon Johnson that prohibits protesters, residents and other onlookers&nbsp;from bringing laptops, large bags, scooters, animals (except for service dogs), unmanned aircraft systems and other items into the DNC&#8217;s security footprint.</p>



<p>The ordinance also gives the police department <a href=""https://occprodstoragev1.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/matterattachmentspublic/35819cc4-9927-40d3-a371-31c991051036.pdf"">the power to deem any item hazardous</a>. Those violating the ordinance could face fines between $100-$500, imprisonment between 10 days to six months or both, according to the ordinance.</p>



<p>The lawsuit filed by Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws argues that the ordinance &#8220;contains no guidelines for law enforcement to ensure that its application is not arbitrary or discriminatory.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;[Johnson is] going against his promises of an open city government and doing this. A government for the people &#8230; it&#8217;s extremely disappointing. And I say that as someone who voted for Mayor Johnson,&#8221; Thayer said.</p>



<p>Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said during a community town hall Tuesday the police department will be out during the DNC to make sure that those who want to protest during the convention &#8220;<a href=""https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/chicago-police-superintendent-addresses-campus-protests-ahead-of-dnc"">can exercise their First Amendment right as long as they are doing it peacefully&#8221; without &#8220;violence, looting or vandalism</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The police department did not respond to questions from Block Club about whether or not Snelling&#8217;s comments apply to those who decide to march without a permit.</p>



<p>Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws said Thursday they plan to march with or without a permit.</p>

<p>NORTH CENTER —&nbsp;Alexander’s Restaurant is now open in the longtime home of Jeri&#8217;s Grill in North Center.</p>



<p>The Mizhquiri family, which operates&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.alexanderschi.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Alexander’s Restaurant</a>&nbsp;at 6158 N. Clark St.,&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/01/07/family-that-owns-alexanders-restaurant-will-open-second-location-at-former-jeris-grill-in-north-center-this-spring/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">bought the former Jeri’s Grill spot at 4357 N. Western Ave. earlier this year</a>&nbsp;and spent <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/07/27/jeris-grill-will-continue-its-legacy-as-a-diner-as-alexanders-restaurant-eyes-september-opening-in-north-center/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">months renovating and updating</a> the interior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The restaurant officially opened Wednesday and it&#8217;s open 6 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sundays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexander’s, which has been in Edgewater since 1960, is a family-owned, Greek, old-school diner serving breakfast and lunch dishes like pancakes, waffles, omelettes, skillets, burgers, soups, salads, sandwiches and desserts.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5cd5f95f34c4e2f892f809c5/t/6351c5d54537c624a4d457e6/1666303445537/10.19.22+Alexanders+Menu.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">menu</a> at the North Center location will be similar to the Edgewater location, said Diana Mizhquiri, one of Alexander’s owners.</p>





<p>Over the winter, the diner&#8217;s homemade soups are one of the more popular menu items, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’ll vary from our two diners, too. So if we have split pea and chicken noodle at the Clark location we’ll have minestrone and navy bean at Montrose,” Mizhquiri said. “There’s a lot of our guests who come on specific days because they want a specific soup.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next month, the family is hosting a free winter dinner for people who are food insecure, unhoused and don’t have a place to go during the holiday season for a home cooked meal, she said. More details will be released soon. </p>



<p>“We wanted to continue to offer a warm place to go eat,” Mizhquiri said. “We’ve encountered a number of people since opening who have nowhere to go, no shelter, no nothing. For us, it’s an honor to host a dinner like this.”</p>


"
527777,"
<p>CHICAGO — A Northwest Side alderperson reported a Streets and Sanitation official in her ward after he was caught on voicemail calling a rabbi an anti-Semitic slur, leading to the employee leaving his longtime city job.</p>



<p>Ald. Samantha Nugent (39th) reported her ward superintendent, Andrew Szorc, to the city&#8217;s Department of Human Resources after she was made aware of the voicemail in September, she said. </p>



<p>The incident was <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/04/15/streets-and-sanitation-ward-boss-caught-using-anti-semitic-slur-on-voicemail-to-resident-inspector-general-says/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">investigated</a> by the city&#8217;s Office of the Inspector General, which recommended the Department of Streets and Sanitation fire Szorc and place him on the city’s do-not-hire list, according to the office&#8217;s <a href=""https://igchicago.org/2022/04/15/oig-first-quarter-report-2022/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">quarterly report</a>, which was released last month. Street and Sanitation officials agreed. Szorc retired before he could be fired.</p>



<p>Szorc could not be reached for comment.</p>



<p>Natalie Kuriata, a spokesperson for the Inspector General, confirmed the office received a complaint from Nugent about the incident.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had a responsibility to report it, which I did,&#8221; Nugent told Block Club. &#8220;The community was obviously very upset about this and wanted it investigated &#8230; and they were also very supportive of the process of the investigation. And so we all remained quiet so that the inspector general could do [its] job.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although the quarterly report does not mention Szorc by name or say when the incident occurred, a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wt4JYacM91NJhRhFmYUPELr7pRS5ES2K/view"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">summary report</a> of the case obtained by&nbsp;Northwest Side political watchdog People’s Fabric states the incident happened Aug. 31 and was reported to the office Sept. 14. </p>



<p>Szorc had been trying to get ahold of a rabbi at a local school to discuss trash and overgrown weeds on campus, according to the report. After leaving a message, Szorc did not hang up and the voicemail continued recording. He was heard saying to another person, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, I left two messages for [unintelligible]. He didn&#8217;t call me back. F&#8212;ing Jew,&#8221; according to the report. </p>



<p>The rabbi who received the voicemail forwarded it to another rabbi, and they brought it to the attention of the alderperson, according to the report and Nugent. The alderperson declined to say who the rabbis are.</p>



<p>When officials with the Office of the Inspector General interviewed Szorc, he admitted it was him on the voicemail and told investigators &#8220;a stroke has affected his speech, so he &#8216;maybe wasn&#8217;t saying it right,'&#8221; according to the report. He said he meant to say &#8220;f&#8212;ing Jewish school&#8221; due to his frustration with trying to get the school cleaned for two weeks with no response, according to the summary report. </p>



<p>The Inspector General determined Szorc&#8217;s statement violated city rules prohibiting discrimination, especially as a representative of the city and while on the clock, according to the report. </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img data-recalc-dims=""1"" loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1400"" height=""931"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/01/123121-New-Years-Downtown-Colin-Boyle-5287.jpg?resize=1400%2C931&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-489798"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">A Streets and Sanitation snowplow. <span class=""image-credit""><span class=""credit-label-wrapper"">Credit:</span> Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Documents show the Inspector General&#8217;s office completed its investigation and delivered its recommendations Dec. 21 to Streets and Sanitation. Szorc took a leave of absence from Dec. 20, the day before the report was finalized, to when he retired in February, according to his city employment history obtained by People&#8217;s Fabric and shared with Block Club. </p>



<p>Szorc stepped down from his role Feb. 23, department spokesperson Mimi Simon said. He&#8217;s since been placed on the city&#8217;s do-not-hire list, she said. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear why there was a three-month delay between the report and the discipline. Streets and Sanitation officials declined to comment, citing personnel matters. </p>



<p>Szorc worked for the city since 1984. He used to work as the <a href=""https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/tale-of-a-ticket/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">32nd Ward superintendent</a> and worked as the 39th Ward superintendent since 2013, according to the Office of the Inspector General&#8217;s summary report.</p>



<p>Nugent said some questioned why she did not take action against Szorc before he retired. While ward superintendents work closely with each alderman, they are employed by <a href=""https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/dhr/supp_info/JobSpecifications/OperationConstruction/8100_Sanitation_Series/8173_WARD_SUPERINTENDENT.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Streets and Sanitation</a> and do not work directly for aldermanic offices. They are still hired and fired by the city department, not alderpeople.</p>



<p>Nugent said a new superintendent began April 1.</p>



<p>Rabbi and Jewish community activist Shlomo Soroka, who was not involved in the incident, said the Jewish community was offended by Szorc&#8217;s comments and was glad to hear the city took action. He has worked with Nugent in the past and called her a strong ally.</p>



<p>&#8220;When we are silent in that rhetoric, it sends a message that anti-Semitism will be tolerated. … We need to come out against it,&#8221; Soroka said.</p>



<p>Soroka also said he felt the incident should not be blown out of proportion and should not be politicized, noting there are &#8220;far more egregious&#8221; anti-Semitic incidents that have hurt the Jewish community locally and nationally.  </p>



<p>Two Jewish businesses, two synagogues and a Jewish school were <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/01/31/west-ridge-synagogues-jewish-businesses-defaced-with-swastika-broken-windows-all-the-hallmarks-of-hate-based-crimes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">defaced in West Ridge</a> earlier this year. Last month, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/us/antisemitic-incidents-2021-report/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">CNN reported</a> the number reports of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/us/antisemitism-incidents-holocaust-education/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">assaults, vandalism and harassment</a>&nbsp;targeting Jewish communities and individuals in the United States in 2021 was the highest on record. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am not surprised someone would speak like that when [they] don&#8217;t listen to what they are saying and let their guard down,&#8221; Soroka said. &#8220;While I was offended, this is not something new. We deal with far more dangerous infractions.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nugent said the upsetting comment was rattling for the rabbi involved and it is important to speak up about it on behalf of her Jewish constituents. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m devastated that they even had to experience this,&#8221; Nugent said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no place for hate speech or anti-Semitism in the city or the 39th Ward.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some neighbors said Szorc&#8217;s controversy is not surprising, given past behavior.</p>



<p>In 2019, public documents shared with Block Club show Szorc<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/03/09/the-city-slapped-a-native-plant-gardener-with-a-600-fine-but-he-fought-back-and-won/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""> issued more than $600 in fines</a> to a Jefferson Park family — despite them not living in the 39th Ward — for failing to maintain their garden and having tall weeds.</p>



<p>The family contested the tickets and showed evidence their plants were not weeds and their garden was maintained. The pest inspector found no evidence of a “rodent problem” and the<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/03/09/the-city-slapped-a-native-plant-gardener-with-a-600-fine-but-he-fought-back-and-won/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""> city’s case was disproven</a>.</p>



<p>The tickets were issued to the resident, a vocal critic of Ald. Jim Gardiner (45th), at the request of his ward superintendent, Charles Sikanich, according to texts between the superintendent, the alderman and his former staffer shared with Block Club.</p>



<p>&#8220;Drew gave them $900 in tickets &#8230;. . That&#8217;s not grass, that&#8217;s some kind of plant or something the city allows you to have,&#8221; Sikanich texted to Gardiner and his aide. &#8220;I have make sure [the resident is] dealt with.&#8221;</p>

Jim Gardiner’s Ward Superintendent Arrested, Charged With Trying To Sell Illegal Machine Gun</a></em></strong></p>



<p>And in 2007, when Szorc worked in the 32nd Ward, <a href=""https://www.windycitytimes.com/lgbt/32nd-Ward-Race-Gets-Ugly/14541.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Windy City Times reported</a> he insulted voters for then-candidate Scott Waguespack at a polling site.</p>



<p>“Szorc told people going in and out of the polling place [at Holstein Park] to not vote for the guy with the f&#8211; brother, the f&#8212;&#8211; brother, the queer brother,&#8221; Sylvestre Waguespack told the paper. Sylvestre Waguespack is gay and was the financial director of his brother’s campaign.</p>



<p>Nugent said she was not aware of these or any other past incidents or derogatory comments from Szorc, and she retained him to work in her ward because he was there previously and had a long-standing career with the department. </p>

<p>LITTLE VILLAGE — Neighbors can now get churros, funnel cakes, milkshakes and more at El Churro Shop, which started as a pandemic pop-up and now has a home.</p>



<p>Husband and wife Aldo Rios and Ana Maciel have been <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/03/02/el-churro-shop-coming-soon-to-little-village-after-pandemic-pop-up-grows-into-a-brick-and-mortar-location/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">working on the store for months</a>, and opened Fourth of July weekend at 3536 W. 26th St.</p>



<p>El Churro Shop is an extension of the pop-up business Rios started during the pandemic,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/all_dohz_churro/?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">All Doh’z Churros</a>. Starting in fall 2020, he sold homemade churros through social media, then moved into having a stand on West 26th Street and at various pop-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rios said the shop is still in a soft opening phase, but community reception already has been very positive. Their opening night was supposed to be a friends and family event, but so many people walking by were interested in what was going on, so they opened up to the public. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was such a hit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We were amazed and full of gratitude that the community was so excited and that they actually accepted it and received it. We want to make it as neighborhood as possible and show that we are proud of Little Village, it is a great neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Churros are served with a choice of house-made dipping sauces and can also come drizzled with sauces or with toppings. The coffee bar uses beans from Bridgeport Coffee and Metropolis Coffee, Rios said. </p>



<p>Rios, who has 14 years of culinary experience, cooked in kitchens in Texas, Mexico City and Chicago before the pandemic. Maciel and the rest of Rios’ family long have pushed him to do branch out on his own, and churros were one of the first things that came to mind, he said.</p>



<p>Rios said he had some knowledge of the traditional dough used to make churros, but the free time he had during quarantine gave him time to experiment with something of his own. Through trial and error, he came up with his own dough, as well as recipes for dipping sauces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dough at El Churro Shop is still Rios&#8217; own creation, but he said he had to tweak the recipe slightly in order to scale up the volume for a larger commercial business.</p>



<p>El Churro Shop is open 8 a.m.-8 p.m. seven days a week.</p>

<p>OLD TOWN — An immersive pop-up themed after the popular Australian kids show &#8220;Bluey&#8221; opens Friday at CAMP Chicago. </p>



<p>The international Emmy Award-winning animated show follows the story of a dog named Bluey and her Heeler family — sister Bingo, dad Bandit and mum Chilli — and has won the hearts of kids and parents alike. The show is collaborating with&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/18/camps-shop-and-play-experience-for-kids-of-all-ages-opens-saturday-in-old-town/"">kids store and experience center CAMP Chicago</a>&nbsp;for Bluey X CAMP, which opens Friday at the shop, 647 W. North Ave., and runs through Sept. 28.</p>



<p>Tickets <a href=""https://camp.com/bluey-chicago"">are for sale online</a> and start at $39. Early weeks of the pop-up&#8217;s run are nearly sold out. </p>



<p>The experience lasts about 50 minutes and takes families behind CAMP&#8217;s magic door and into Bluey&#8217;s house, exploring the bedroom where Bluey dreamed of the cosmos in &#8220;Sleepytime,&#8221; the kitchen where the Heeler sisters played a cheeky game of café in &#8220;Pavlova&#8221; and other backdrops to the family&#8217;s most precious moments. </p>



<p>Kids can play Keepy Uppy and Freeze Dance with the CAMP staff and traverse forts, slides and more before meeting-and-greeting Bluey and Bingo in their backyard in the grand finale.</p>

<p>MAYFAIR — After 15 years of living in parks and under bridges, Amanda Hernandez got one step closer to finding stable housing on Wednesday. </p>



<p>Hernandez was one of 29 Gompers Park encampment residents who signed up for an Accelerated Moving Event, or AME, coordinated by the city. The AME, which connects people who are homeless with housing units and rental assistance, followed months of tensions at the park. </p>



<p>Some encampment residents and housing advocates feared the AME would result in an encampment sweep, like what happened at <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/12/05/homeless-advocates-humboldt-park-tent-residents-push-back-on-citys-planned-encampment-closure/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Humboldt Park at the end of last year.</a> But city leaders have said the Gompers Park encampment will not be cleared, and followed through on that pledge Wednesday despite some early morning confusion.</p>

<p>Department of Family and Support Services vans arrived around 10 a.m. Wednesday to take AME participants to the Salvation Army headquarters nearby. Officials said media and members of the public would not be allowed inside the Salvation Army due to the personal information being shared by residents. Encampment residents later said they were shown virtual housing and furniture options and were connected with social services.</p>



<p>Chief Homelessness Officer Sendy Soto&nbsp;said the AME was optional and that residents would not be forced out of the park.</p>



<p>Yet police arrived at Gompers Park around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday and told residents there would be a sweep later that morning, encampment residents and advocates said. A woman who lives a few blocks away but declined to share her name out of fear of retaliation from her neighbors said she showed up to the park around 6:20 a.m. and a police officer was blocking the entrance. The officer told her encampment residents were going to be kicked out, the woman said.</p>



<p>Soto&nbsp;said she heard about the police interactions and she apologized for the confusion.</p>



<p>“It looks like we need to look into perhaps a miscommunication, but we cleared it up immediately and that officer was asked to leave the area,&#8221; she said. </p>



<p>Tanya, a Gompers Park resident who declined to share her last name, participated in the AME but asked a friend to watch her tent because she was worried it would be destroyed while she was gone. About a week and a half ago, city crews destroyed a yurt in which Tanya resided, <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/02/21/city-destroys-yurts-arrests-tent-resident-in-gompers-park-weeks-before-housing-help-set-to-arrive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">one of five yurts taken during the removal</a>. The city also <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/02/19/city-crews-tear-down-tents-at-gompers-park-encampment-on-one-of-the-coldest-mornings-of-the-year/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">removed three vacant tents and a heating structure two days earlier.</a></p>



<p>Adam Gianforte, a Mayfair resident and member of 39th Ward Neighbors United, said the police presence Wednesday morning &#8220;created an atmosphere of chaos and fear.&#8221;</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, the people who suffer most from the miscommunication are the residents of this encampment who are already struggling to survive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to see people get housing, we’re excited about the AME. What we don’t want to see is our unhoused neighbors being harassed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hernandez, who has been living at Gompers Park for about three years and has been on the city&#8217;s list for affordable housing for at least seven years, said she lost some of her belongings during the yurt removal. </p>



<p>But she felt hopeful as she walked out of the AME Wednesday afternoon, she said. Caseworkers were able to find her a unit at Sarah&#8217;s Circle, a nonprofit based in Uptown that helps women who are homeless. Hernandez said she was told she&#8217;ll be able to tour the unit as soon as Tuesday.</p>



<p>Maura McCauley, acting commissioner for the city’s Department of Family and Support Services, said Gompers encampment residents who find a unit through the AME will likely be housed within 30 to 90 days.</p>



<p>About 740 people have been connected with housing through AMEs since the city started conducting them in 2020, McCauley said. Wednesday was the city&#8217;s 35th AME.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-not-on-the-list"">Not On The List </h2>



<p>Gompers Park, 4222 W. Foster Ave., has been home to a handful of encampment residents for years, and a nearby parking lot has been a gathering spot for day laborers for decades, Monica Dillon of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100071525365388"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Chicago Northwest Side Homeless Outreach</a> said.</p>



<p>Dillon said the encampment started to expand around the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Wednesday, there were 12 tents off Pulaski Avenue and four on the other side of the park, along Foster Avenue.</p>



<p>A local group dubbed the Restore Gompers Park Coalition began pushing for an AME last year. Calls for an AME multiplied last month&nbsp;<a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/02/12/after-3-fires-and-pit-bull-attack-near-tent-encampment-kids-sports-could-be-pulled-from-gompers-park/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">after three fires broke out in one week</a>. A member of the encampment said he heard the fires were accidental and caused by propane tanks being used to provide warmth to those living in the park.</p>



<p>A neighbor’s dog was also attacked by an off-leash pit bull in the park, Ald. Samantha Nugent (39th) said. Dillon said she was familiar with the pit bull and that it was reactive to other dogs. The dog’s owner placed the animal in foster care shortly after the attack, Dillon said.</p>



<p>The Gompers Park Athletic Association, which runs youth baseball and softball programs at the park, has said the athletic league was considering relocating because of the encampment.</p>



<p>Gianforte lives a few blocks away from Gompers and said he often takes his 3-year-old son to the park. He said he’s gotten to know many of the encampment residents.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“When people say we can’t use the park, I don’t really understand that, it doesn’t make sense to me,” Gianforte said. “This is just a very vulnerable, poor population and yes, some of them are struggling with substance use, but they need support for that, not criminalization, not harassment.”</p>



<p>Last month, Nugent asked the city to intervene and help those in the park find housing sooner. But she was told the moving event would be delayed to Wednesday due to&nbsp;President Donald Trump’s attempts to freeze federal funding.</p>



<p>The city spends about $30,000 over 24 months per household when it enrolls someone in its support services via an AME, city officials have said. Residents connected with housing at Gompers will receive rental assistance for up to 12 months, a spokesperson with DFSS said.</p>



<p>Not everyone at Gompers Park was able to find housing on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Gompers Park resident Allan Lacey, who has been unhoused for almost five years, said he couldn&#8217;t find any viable options on Wednesday. The 62-year-old ended up at Gompers after the Tremont Hotel shelter in the Gold Coast closed in September.</p>



<p>Lacey wants to stay on the Northwest Side because he has congestive heart failure and all of his medical care is in the area. The only North Side apartment he was shown during the AME was a unit in Logan Square that had a shared bathroom and a shared kitchen.</p>

<p>Pete, who also came from the Tremont Hotel and now lives at Gompers in a tent next to Lacey&#8217;s, said he didn&#8217;t get to participate in the AME on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Even though Pete, who declined to share his last name, has been on the city&#8217;s housing list since fall 2023, he said he was never signed up for the AME. Though DFSS officials said outreach workers were in the park at least four days per week during the month leading up to the AME, Pete said he usually isn&#8217;t home between 10 a.m.-7 p.m. and never got on the list.</p>



<p>&#8220;They just told me I wasn&#8217;t on the list and that I should keep calling,&#8221; Pete said. &#8220;That’s the same thing I heard a year ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>Encampment resident Victor Manuel Sanchez, who goes by Manny, also said he was never added to the AME list. Sanchez had previously been living at a bridge near Gompers for about five years. He left for a year and came back to the park in January.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have to go look for work. I can&#8217;t just stay at the park all day,&#8221; Sanchez said in Spanish.</p>



<p>For now, all three men said they plan to stay at Gompers and wait to hear back from the city.</p>



<p>Andrea Chatman, deputy commissioner of homeless services with DFSS, said no additional participants could be added Wednesday because a specific number of units were set aside for the AME.</p>



<p>Lacey said that if he gets kicked out of Gompers, he&#8217;ll move to an encampment along the lakefront.</p>



<p>While Soto has said no one will be removed from Gompers Park, residents might be relocated to different parts of the park when planned restoration work begins.</p>



<p>Nugent said funding for a nature play space near the Pulaski Avenue encampment was approved through her <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/06/04/northwest-side-neighbors-can-vote-on-how-to-spend-500000-in-the-39th-ward/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">participatory budgeting process</a> three years ago. The project was delayed because of the encampment, but she hopes the Park District will begin work on the $50,000 project as soon as possible, Nugent said.</p>



<p>There are also plans to resurface the parking lot next to the encampment, Nugent wrote in an email to residents. Relocation notices will be posted near the Gompers Park baseball field before the baseball season begins April 1, the alderwoman wrote.</p>



<p>Soto said the city &#8220;cannot force people out of any public space without giving them an option to move into a shelter or housing, which we don&#8217;t have at scale at the moment.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-scared-but-excited"">&#8216;Scared But Excited&#8217; </h2>



<p>While city outreach workers have offered encampment residents shelter, McCauley said that only about 10 have accepted since December.</p>



<p>Dillon has said most <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/01/27/city-agrees-to-find-housing-for-gompers-park-tent-encampment-but-some-fear-leaving-the-nw-side/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">encampment residents want to stay on the Northwest Side</a>&nbsp;because that’s where their jobs, support systems and doctors are located. But the closest shelters are the <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/12/09/rogers-park-mens-homeless-shelter-opens-on-clark-street-after-years-of-planning/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">recently opened men&#8217;s shelter in Rogers Park</a> and a <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/29/city-poised-to-buy-north-park-marines-building-to-turn-it-into-migrant-shelter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">family shelter in North Park</a>.</p>



<p>Chatman said the city issued a request for proposal for a low-barrier shelter on the Northwest Side last year and received no applicants.</p>



<p>All of the affordable housing units that the city offered through the Wednesday AME were identified by <a href=""https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/08/08/a-housing-program-wants-to-find-vacant-apartments-to-rent-to-people-in-need/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Chicago Rents, a program that connects renters with government subsidies</a> and provides building owners with financial incentives to rent vacant units to low-income tenants, a DFSS spokesperson said.</p>



<p>A spokesperson with All Chicago, the group that leads the program, said there are currently no Chicago Rents units on the Far Northwest Side. </p>



<p>Chatman said most of the landlords who work with Chicago Rents are located on the South and West Sides of the city.</p>



<p>“We would like to keep people in their community of origin, but sometimes that’s not where the units are,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>DFSS did not have final numbers on how many residents had been connected with housing during the AME as of Wednesday evening. A spokesperson for the department said unoccupied tents would be removed from the park during the next monthly cleaning on March 19.</p>



<p>Hernandez said she was &#8220;scared but excited&#8221; to be moving into an apartment. After living communally with her fellow Gompers Park residents for so long, she said she felt nervous to be on her own.</p>



<p>“Everybody’s moving in different directions, but we’ll all stay friends,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s close to the train, so it&#8217;ll be easy to get back over here and maybe I&#8217;ll get to know people over there too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just excited to hang up art, do the dishes, just little things like that you know,&#8221; Hernandez said with a smile. </p>

<p>BEVERLY — Days after its soft opening, a new Beverly pizza restaurant that aims to fund for programs Englewood kids has been forced to close up shop because of nearby Metra construction. </p>



<p>Owner Tamar Manasseh, who recently opened Peace of Pizza, 1801 W. 95th St., said the Metra construction project that began last week is three days away from completion, but the damage has already been done. Instead of a grand opening sign, she&#8217;s contending with a &#8220;sidewalk close&#8221; sign inches from the restaurant&#8217;s front door, and is now worried a July 31 grand opening celebration won&#8217;t happen. </p>



<p>Manasseh, founder of Mothers Against Senseless Killing (MASK), had hoped that the profits from the pizzeria would help defray the cost of the school the organization is opening in Englewood later this year but said that the construction has already eaten away at her inventory. Metra crews are working on a nearby railway crosswalk as part of the project. </p>



<p>&#8220;This has slowed everything down. I&#8217;ve got bread growing mold, sausages and vegetables going bad,&#8221; Manasseh told Block Club Tuesday. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost about $10,000 in inventory and $3,000 in advertising.&#8221;</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img data-recalc-dims=""1"" loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""2344"" height=""1561"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/07/tamar.jpg?resize=2344%2C1561&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-153267""/><figcaption>Tamar Manasseh, founder of Mothers Against Senseless Killings (MASK), at an event in May.  <span class=""image-credit""><span class=""credit-label-wrapper"">Credit:</span> Jamie Nesbitt Golden/ Block Club Chicago</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Manasseh is also worried about her ability to compensate the restaurant&#8217;s three employees, all of whom were hired from Englewood. She said she&#8217;s attempted to contact Metra executives in hopes of finding a resolution, but only one representative was willing to speak with her, she said. </p>



<p>&#8220;No one warned us about the construction. The two other businesses on the block are affected by this, too,&#8221; she said. </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img data-recalc-dims=""1"" loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""4032"" height=""3024"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1480.jpg?resize=4032%2C3024&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-153111""/><figcaption>The construction site at the intersection of 95th and Wood Street.   <span class=""image-credit""><span class=""credit-label-wrapper"">Credit:</span> Jamie Nesbitt Golden/ Block Club Chicago </span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The two other businesses on the block, Blu Lady Wellness Boutique and Beverly Hills Marketplace, were also closed. An employee at Oriental Chop Suey, located directly across from Peace of Pizza, said the project has impacted their sales as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;People call in their orders but can&#8217;t get to us, so they give up,&#8221; said the cashier who declined to be named, a nephew of the owner.</p>



<p>Metra spokeswoman Meg Riele said businesses were informed two weeks before the project&#8217;s start date, and that the permit allowing for the work was approved by the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Chicago Department of Transportation and Ald. Matt O&#8217;Shea (19th).</p>



<p>This is a standard crossing replacement. We do it every 10 years, if that,&#8221; said Riele, who added that she&#8217;d been fielding calls about the project since last week. &#8220;It&#8217;s necessary maintenance for the railroad. The alderman could&#8217;ve rescheduled it, if he wanted.&#8221;</p>



<p>O&#8217;Shea couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment, but Manasseh feels that the alderman has done everything he could do, placing the blame squarely on Metra. </p>



<p>&#8220;If we take money from the school to open the restaurant, it would be counterproductive. They have to fix this. This is on them. There has to be some compensation,&#8221; Manasseh said. </p>

<p>BRIGHTON PARK — The family of a Brighton Park woman has launched a <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-alicias-medical-and-recovery-costs"">GoFundMe</a> campaign to pay for her medical bills after a driver hit her truck while she was cooking.</p>



<p>Alicia Robles was cooking at the corner of West 47th and South Whipple streets about 8 p.m. Nov. 13 when a driver hit the truck, according to her daughter, Yulisa Hurtado.</p>



<p>Hot oil from a frying pan splashed onto Robles&#8217;s face and body, causing third-degree burns to her face, eye, chest, arms and upper back, Hurtado said.</p>



<p>A Chevrolet Tahoe was traveling east on 47th Street when it hit the back left corner of Robles&#8217;s food truck, pushing it into another parked vehicle, police said. The male driver of the SUV fled, police said. No one is in custody, and an investigation is ongoing, according to police.</p>



<p>Hurtado said she and her brother, who was there immediately after crash, believe the driver may have been drunk.</p>



<p>The driver fled &#8220;when he realized what he had done,&#8221; Hurtado said.</p>



<p>Robles was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital after the crash and was later transferred to Stroger Hospital for treatment, Hurtado said. Robles had surgery Thursday, her daughter said. </p>



<p>&#8220;She is still in pain, but she is able to speak,&#8221; Hurtado said.  </p>



<p>The GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $6,800 of its $85,000 goal as of Sunday. </p>



<p>Depending on how her burns heal, Robles could leave the hospital before Thanksgiving, Hurtado said. However, doctors estimate that it could be three to five months before Robles will be able to work again, Hurtado said. </p>



<p>Her food truck was damaged, but can likely be salvaged, Hurtado said.</p>



<p>Robles sold Mexican food like tacos, burritos, tortas and salchipapas out of a food trailer most nights from 6-11 p.m. She had set up her truck at West 47th and South Whipple streets for about a month, Hurtado said.</p>



<p>Robles, a mother of four, lived alone prior to the crash. Her family will struggle to help her pay rent, medical bills and other expenses while she is unable to work, Hurtado said. In the past few years, Robles was underwent treatment for liver cancer, from which she recovered, Hurtado said. Robles also suffers from diabetes, which worsened after the crash, her daughter said.</p>



<p>&#8220;As she goes through the pain, we ask for anything that helps pay for her medical bills,&#8221; Hurtado wrote on the GoFundMe page. &#8220;We pray that she will have a speedy recovery.&#8221;</p>

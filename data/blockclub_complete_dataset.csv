				Mina Bloom",6 hours ago,The Watch,NA,"CITY HALL — After enduring psychological abuse at the hands of her partner, Margarita Trujillo decided several years ago to “change [her] own situation” and seek counseling from a local community organization, she said. But the Little Village mother was denied services because the organization only provided counseling to survivors of physical abuse. “It deeply saddened me because, psychologically, I felt not well. It did not seem fair. I wish I had the emotional support I needed,” Trujillo said in Spanish while addressing a City Council committee Wednesday. Now a survivor leader with the organization Healing to Action, Trujillo is among a growing number of advocates demanding more city funding to fight high levels of domestic violence, an alarming trend that has worsened since the COVD-19 pandemic lockdowns. RELATED: As Chicago’s Domestic Violence Crisis Deepens, Victims Suffer In Silence During the hearing convened by the council’s Committee on Health and Human Services, advocates representing a range of local organizations pushed alderpeople to support a significant increase in resources for gender-based violence services. Mayor Brandon Johnson is expected to release his 2026 budget recommendations next month, which will kick off weeks of discussions and negotiations with City Council members. Overall violence in the city has decreased significantly in recent years, according to Chicago police figures. Yet domestic violence remains higher than pre-pandemic levels, Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st) noted at the hearing. As of Wednesday, domestic homicides were up 18 percent over last year, according to the city’s violence reduction dashboard. Fatal domestic shootings have increased by 46 percent over the same time period. Calls to the Illinois domestic violence hotline have more than doubled since before the pandemic. Yet city funding for gender-based violence services is set to drop dramatically. This year, the city budgeted $21 million for gender-based violence services, which include community-based programs that offer legal aid, counseling and advocacy, and rapid rehousing. That investment is expected to shrink by half as COVID-era federal funding runs out and as funds from a tax on short-term housing rentals are depleted, according to figures provided by the city. A Block Club investigation earlier this year highlighted the funding shortfalls. It also recounted the story of DeMarie’ Williams, who was killed, allegedly by her boyfriend, after months of abuse, according to prosecutors and her family and friends. The city reductions would also come after deep cuts to the federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) program. VOCA is supported by fines and penalties collected through federal criminal cases. Because the number of federal prosecutions has dropped and the Justice Department is reaching more settlements, VOCA funding fell by 40 percent in 2024. Though the state recently increased funding for gender-based violence services, it hasn’t been enough to close the deficit created by VOCA cuts, organization leaders have said. Resilience, a crisis center that provides services to rape and sexual assault survivors, lost half a million dollars from VOCA cuts, said organization leader Sarah Layden. That meant the organization had to terminate six full-time positions, a mix of advocates and trauma therapists, she said. Gender-based violence organizations across the city are now scrambling again as pandemic subsides dry up. “With the end of [American Rescue Plan Act] funding, we’re now expected to serve more survivors with more complex needs with less money,” Layden said. Immigrant survivors in particular need more resources in light of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts across the city, said Sayeed Sanchez, advocacy and policy manager for Mujeres Latinas en Acción, a bilingual organization focused on serving Latina survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Earlier this month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took two people into custody at Cook County’s domestic violence court. “As survivors are being targeted more and more over their immigration status, Chicago has a powerful opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to meeting all of the needs of all Chicagoans, inclusive of immigrant survivors,” Sanchez said at the committee hearing. The city’s overall financial outlook is gloomy. Chicago is facing a budget shortfall of $146 million for the rest of 2025 and a projected gap of more than $1 billion for 2026. Still, alderpeople voiced support for putting more resources into combating the domestic violence epidemic. “I think we should be looking not just to maintain those funds but to expand at a time when public safety continues to be top of mind for many Chicagoans,” Ald. Matt Martin (47th) said. “We need to make sure we’re doubling down on our investments on services that are working to [address] a growing problem.” Support Local News!

				Molly DeVore",5 hours ago,North Park,NA,"NORTH PARK — Federal immigration agents detained and then released two people Tuesday outside a homeless shelter in Budlong Woods, according to the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. About 7:30 a.m. Tuesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at the family shelter at 3034 W. Foster Ave., said Andre Gordillo, director of the family support network for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Shelter staff did not let the ICE agents in, but two residents were detained outside the shelter. Gordillo said shelter staff confirmed the residents were later released, though he did not know how long they were held or where they were taken. Elected officials and activists held a press conference Wednesday at River Park to denounce the detainment. “This is an immigrant neighborhood, and we are going to protect our people,” said Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd). Rodriguez-Sanchez went to the shelter and spoke with the staff Tuesday morning. Volunteers with the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team and the Albany Park Defense Network also patrolled the area Tuesday. Shelter staff said ICE agents were looking for a man who no longer lived at the shelter, Gordillo said. The Northwest Side Rapid Response Team issued a community alert about the activity Tuesday morning. The Budlong Woods shelter was formerly a Marine Corps building. It was bought by the city in 2023 as thousands of asylum seekers were arriving in Chicago. The shelter was originally used to house migrants, many of whom were fleeing political and economic upheaval in Venezuela. It became a family shelter after the city combined the migrant and the homeless shelter systems last year. Ald. Samantha Nugent (39th), whose ward encompasses the shelter, said she wishes the federal government would “ask us what we need because we need a lot of things.” “We would welcome the opportunity to work with the federal government to provide more housing,” she said. Gordillo and Doug Schenkelberg, executive director of the Chicago Coalition to End Homelessness, said Tuesday was the first time they’d heard of an ICE agent detaining someone outside a homeless shelter in Chicago. Schenkelberg said he has not heard about ICE agents targeting any homeless encampments in the city, but “it’s something we’ve been worried about.” Shelters, schools, churches and hospitals were considered sensitive locations and were protected from immigration enforcement under former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump ended these protections in January. “People who have nowhere else to go should have access to shelter and other lifesaving services without fear of detainment,” said Arturo Hernandez, an attorney with the Chicago Coalition to End Homelessness. Marcos Charles, acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, recently said about 50-60 percent of the Chicago operation arrests were targeted arrests. That means they were specific people that ICE was trying to find because they had committed a crime, said Ramona Riecke, of the Albany Park Defense Network. “In other words, despite their stated goals, ICE openly admits that they are arresting and detaining people without criminal backgrounds,” Riecke said. “They are targeting all members of our communities at all hours of the day and with increasing aggression.” Riecke said volunteers will continue to patrol the area for the next few days. She encouraged anyone who sees potential lCE activity to contact the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights at 855-435-7693. “We have a vast and wide coalition of people in Albany Park that will stand up and love and defend our neighbors,” state Sen. Graciela Guzmán said. “They could stand to learn a lesson from Chicago.” Support Local News! Subscribe to Block Club Chicago, an independent, 501(c)(3), journalist-run newsroom.

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/25/leo-high-school-choir-nabs-4th-place-in-americas-got-talent/,Leo High School Choir Nabs 4th Place In ‘America’s Got Talent’,"by
				Leigh Giangreco",4 hours ago,"Englewood, Chatham, Auburn Gresham",NA,"CHICAGO — The wild ride for the Leo High School choir came to an end Wednesday night as “America’s Got Talent” host Terry Crews announced the singing group came in fourth place during the show’s season finale. The choir, made up of 18 students from the all-boys Catholic high school on the South Side, performed on Tuesday night as one of 10 finalists. Led by Choir Director LaDonna Hill, the boys sang a lively rendition of The Script’s “Hall of Fame.” Dressed in combat boots and preppy cardigans emblazoned with the letter “L,” the choir came out stomping and clapping to the beat. When orange and white streamers, the school’s colors, shot out from the stage, you could see Leo Principal Shaka Rawls beaming in the audience. “I am thrilled with all of you,” said judge Simon Cowell, known for being the most critical of the four celebrity judges. “Look, it doesn’t matter what we say; it’s what is happening behind me. The energy … I watch people when you perform, and you just have an ability to make people feel great.” Judge Howie Mandel pointed straight at the camera and toward the viewers at home, urging them to vote for the choir. “You’re the kings of saying, ‘Don’t judge a book by its cover.’ You hear there’s a choir coming up next, you have a certain image,” Mandel told the group. “But you guys are a vibe. I’d go to see you; I’d buy tickets. You need to vote for them.” The choir was out front and center once again when the “America’s Got Talent” results show kicked off Wednesday with a happy birthday song celebrating the 20th season of the series. For their final performance, the boys sang “I’m the Man” with Aloe Blacc. When fellow competitor Steve Ray Ladson strapped on his guitar and played his original song, “Boots Like Mine,” the boys returned to this stage. This time, they donned cowboy hats and boots, joining Ladson in a funky version of line dancing. A post shared by America's Got Talent – AGT (@agt) Even as they achieved national fame during their run to the finals, Blacc encouraged the boys — none of whom are trained singers — to keep pushing. “You’ve already made it to one of the greatest stages in the world,” Blacc told them. “Dream bigger and never, ever give up.” After 45 minutes of performances and recaps, the show finally whittled down the remaining competitors, with the Leo choir vying for the last of five spots against the dance crew, Team Recycled. While Crews waited to announce the winner of the fifth spot, the crowd chanted, “LEO, LEO, LEO!” When Leo emerged victorious, the boys held their hands over their mouths in disbelief. Hill clasped her hands and turned her eyes up. “You see who didn’t make it through,” Cowell said. “It makes you realize how good these acts are.” The choir didn’t make it past the next round, however, placing fourth. “You are gonna inspire so many people, and I really mean that,” Cowell told the group. “I’m so proud of what you’ve achieved. You have an amazing mentor.” In an interview with Block Club after the results were announced, Hill expressed a mix of disappointment that the choir didn’t win the overall competition; gratitude for every educator and parent at the school; and pride in her students, who she said had been given the opportunity to “grow exponentially” with each round in the show. Hill never expected her choir would end up on a platform like “America’s Got Talent” or that they would return for several rounds. “Many of them I’ve had for four years. What we built is relational. Beyond music, it was building trust. It was building character,” Hill said. “So for God to allow us to have gotten to this plateau is absolutely a blessing and a miracle, and it speaks, I think, to their character, to what I’ve always seen in them.” Hill isn’t sure what’s next for her. She had decided in the spring that this year would mark her final year with Leo, as she wants to take time to decompress, spend time with family and enjoy her church community. “I don’t know if a movie will come out, books. I don’t know how this will work out,” she said. The praise Hill received from Cowell already felt like a scene straight out of a movie, she said. The famous judge repeatedly called her his “favorite mentor” throughout the show. “For him to have seen me and said that was like a thank-you from all of the thousands of families and kids — hundreds, definitely — over the 25 year period of being there at Leo,” she said. “It was like a kiss from God.” The boys aren’t leaving the competition empty-handed. In an introduction video before their performance Tuesday, one of the boys said he “felt that we were underdogs” and noted the struggle that many kids in Chicago face. Hill’s choir was what motivated him to come to school. “We’re all leaving as men,” he said. Support Local News! Subscribe to Block Club Chicago, an independent, 501(c)(3), journalist-run newsroom.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Chicago’s free daily newsletter to keep up with the latest education news. CHICAGO — Chicago will lose millions in federal funding for magnet schools this year due to a dispute with the U.S. Department of Education over how the district serves Black and transgender students. Trump administration officials said $5.8 million will not be awarded to Chicago in the coming year under the Magnet Schools Assistance Program and $17.5 million would not be awarded for the remaining years of the district’s grants. As a result, Chicago Public Schools now faces a $8 million hole in its current $10.2 billion budget, district officials said Wednesday. Some of that total is carryover funds from last year. The federal government and CPS operate on different fiscal calendars, with Chicago’s starting July 1 and the federal government starting Oct. 1. The new multimillion dollar budget hole comes as Chicago continues to be a target of the Trump administration on various policy issues, including diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in public schools. Despite the funding fight, CPS is continuing to forge ahead with a Black Student Success Plan it rolled out in February and a Black Student Achievement Committee mandated by Illinois law. The district is also maintaining compliance with the Illinois Human Rights Act requirements to allow transgender students access to bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. Both are subject to ongoing investigations by the Trump administration.",255,https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/12/vF0aHP3X_400x400.jpg,Trump administration officials said $5.8 million will not be awarded to Chicago in the coming year under the Magnet Schools Assistance Program and $17.5 million would not be awarded for the remaining years of the district’s grants.,2025-09-25T19:35:01Z,5,40
https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/25/vacant-pilsen-lot-could-become-affordable-housing-for-seniors-under-developers-plan/,Vacant Pilsen Lot Could Become Affordable Housing For Seniors Under Developer’s Plan,"by
				Francia Garcia Hernandez",6 hours ago,"Pilsen, Little Village, Back of the Yards",NA,"PILSEN — A vacant lot at 16th Street and Wolcott Avenue could be turned into an affordable apartment building with over 100 units for older people. Developer Teo Scorte plans to build a seven-story, 106-unit apartment building for people 55 and older at 1606 S. Wolcott Ave. All apartments would be rented at affordable rates and all units would meet accessibility standards, Rolando Acosta, the developer’s lawyer, said at a community meeting Monday. The building, dubbed Casa Bienestar, would have 94 one-bedroom and 12 two-bedroom units. People 55 and older whose income is at 30, 60 and 80 percent of the area median income could apply. Rents would range from $675 to $1,800, Acosta said. There would be parking for 21 cars and a bike room. The building would have a ground-floor courtyard, commercial spaces aimed to attract social service providers, a community room, a library, a lobby and a gym, Acosta said. A laundry room would be built on every floor, and the top floor would have another community room and a terrace, Acosta said. On the ground floor, the developer plans to add two walls — one along South Wolcott Avenue and one along the alley — where murals could be painted, Acosta said. It would be Scorte’s first fully affordable housing project for older people. The idea for it came in response to feedback shared by neighbors in community meetings about other projects, Acosta said. “We’ve had enough meetings where the community has been asking for more and more affordable housing. … Essentially, we’re trying to respond and provide what you asked for,” Acosta said. To make way for the development, the lot would need to be rezoned from a light industry use to a neighborhood mixed-use. The lot borders the railroad tracks on the north side, so the developer would have to leave room for the railroad embankment, Acosta said. The lot is also at a higher elevation than the sidewalk, so the developer would need to re-grade the lot. The development team completed environmental testing at the site — including a review of the lot’s historical use and testing soil samples — and found no environmental hazards, Acosta said Some neighbors at the community meeting asked how Scorte can guarantee the building will be used for senior housing. Acosta said the developer is applying for zoning changes and financial support from the city and state that would restrict the property to housing for people 55 and older. If the zoning change is approved, it would only allow the developer to build affordable housing for older people. If city and state funds were not granted and the developer changed its plans, Scorte would have to seek a new zoning change, Acosta said. Other neighbors said the parking lot is too small, so residents could be forced to park in the neighborhood, making it harder for neighbors to find a spot. The development would be near public transportation and meet local parking requirements for senior housing facilities, Acosta said. The 25th Ward’s zoning advisory board recommended hosting a community meeting due to the project’s size and because the developer needs a zoning change to move forward, said Lucia Moya Calderon, chief of staff for the Ald. Byron Sigcho- Lopez. The ward’s zoning board will review the feedback submitted by neighbors and the meeting’s notes to issue a recommendation to Sigcho-Lopez, who needs to sign off on the rezoning before it heads to City Council. Members of the board Victoria Romero and Cynthia Nambo told Block Club they would recommend hosting another community meeting about the project for neighbors who might have missed Monday’s meeting due to fear of immigration raids. Neighbors can share their feedback with the 25th Ward office by calling 773-523-4100, emailing ward25@cityofchicago.org.mail or filling out an online form.

				Quinn Myers",4 hours ago,"Wicker Park, Bucktown, West Town",NA,"BUCKTOWN — A resale boutique known for sourcing hard-to-find vintage clothing, sneakers, streetwear and other collectibles is closing its brick-and-mortar store following a burglary in August. The Pop-Up, 1753 N. Damen Ave., was broken into early Aug. 19. Owner Kevin Woods said burglars took about 400 items — about a third of the store’s inventory. That incident was just the latest burglary Woods and his co-owner and wife Molly have experienced since they launched The Pop-Up in 2019 and opened in Fulton Market in 2020. The couple decided to move their store to Bucktown in 2024 after their West Loop storefront was broken into twice in February 2024. After the burglary this summer, Woods has been grappling with how to move forward with his business, and he ultimately has decided to shift to selling only online and hosting brand activations and other events, he said. The Pop-Up is hosting a final sale Friday-Sunday, after which the store will close for good. On Wednesday, Woods said he’s trying to stay positive and reflect on everything he and his wife have accomplished over the past six years and all the people and brands they’ve gotten to work with. “What I would tell other people who are entrepreneurs, or younger entrepreneurs, is: You can’t forget your ‘why,'” Woods said. “If your ‘why’ is to have fun and enjoy what you do and work with your friends and build a little space for people to hang out — that was my ‘why,’ and I feel like we accomplished that.” A post shared by thepopup.com📍 (@thepopupdotcom) Kevin and Molly Woods launched The Pop-Up in 2019 when they started doing one-off events at college campuses and in Chicago. They eventually landed a permanent store at 208 N. Green St. in Fulton Market. But in early 2024, the business was broken into twice, resulting in about $200,000 in losses, Woods told Block Club at the time. Many of The Pop-Up’s products are one-of-a-kind and impossible to replace. The burglaries were an “inflection point” for The Pop-Up, causing the couple to close temporarily and seek out a new location, Woods said. They were also outgrowing the original West Loop storefront, he said. After a short hiatus, The Pop-Up reopened in May 2024 in a Bucktown storefront, which was previously home to RSVP Gallery, a well-known boutique for pop art, streetwear and luxury goods created by local legends Don Crawley and the late Virgil Abloh. “I’m humbled — to be honest with you — to have an opportunity to occupy the space after what was here,” Kevin Woods told Block Club in 2024. “We’re thankful for the community for kind of rocking with what we got going on.” To stock The Pop-Up and find unique items, Kevin and Molly Woods have traveled numerous times to Japan, and they have even brought staff along to do so. The expense that goes into restocking the store, especially after the latest burglary, is one reason why Woods said he decided to shift to online-only. Another is the emotional toll the break-in has taken on his family, he said. “You can only deal with so much of that,” Woods said. “When I hear alarms now, it’s triggering. Lack of sleep, lack of health, my well-being, you know, all the things you can imagine going through.” Now, Woods is planning to slowly rebuild The Pop-Up’s online inventory and focus on an in-house brand, while also spending more time with his wife and kids, he said. This weekend’s close-out sale is a way to thank the neighborhood and customers who have supported The Pop-Up since 2019. Merchandise will be 50 percent off Friday, 60 percent off Saturday and 75 percent off Sunday, the store’s final day in business. “Come and get a deal, take advantage of the sale, and then just have one last cheers to the effort that the team has put in over the past six years,” Woods said.

				Madison Savedra",20 hours ago,"Uptown, Edgewater, Rogers Park",NA,"ROGERS PARK — Sister Jean, Loyola University Chicago’s beloved figurehead, has retired from campus duties, the university said. In a message to the Loyola community on Sister Jean’s 106th birthday last month, university President Mark Reed confirmed she’s no longer participating in campus activity. “While Sister Jean is no longer able to be physically present on campus, she remains a beloved friend, trusted advisor, and loyal Rambler — cheering for our teams and praying for us all daily,” Reed wrote. Sister Jean, a mainstay on Loyola’s campuses, wrote to students on her Aug. 21 birthday, saying she had a “bad summer cold and other health issues.” Those issues meant she wouldn’t be celebrating her birthday on campus, though students were given a Sister Jean pen to commemorate her milestone. “It has been wonderful for me to be with you these years and to watch you grow spiritually, intellectually, and socially, and to see the friends you’ve made,” the sister wrote. “And to see the progress you’ve made in your academic life. I’ve always been happy to share my time with you.” Sister Jean was born Dolores Bertha Schmidt on Aug. 21, 1919 in San Francisco, according to Loyola. From a young age, she knew she wanted to devote her life to religion. In 1938, she became a member of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and took on the name Sister Jean Dolores. She joined Mundelein College, Loyola’s now-defunct sister school, in 1961 to teach and remained there when the school was bought by Loyola University. She became the Loyola men’s basketball team chaplain in 1996. As chaplain, she supported the athletes through prayer and advice both on and off the court, and became a beloved figure to the entire school community. RELATED: Sister Jean Turns 101 During Unprecedented School Year, Warns Students Not To Party Sister Jean’s international fame came during the Loyola men’s basketball team’s historic run in the 2018 NCAA March Madness tournament, which ended with a loss in the Final Four. She was continually featured on nationally televised coverage of the Ramblers’ games, getting shout-outs from luminaries like Chicago native and former President Barack Obama. In the years since, she’s been immortalized in a bobblehead, had the Loyola Red Line plaza named in her honor and guided the community through the pandemic — the second one she has lived through. She has also written a memoir and received a presidential proclamation on her 105 birthday from former President Joe Biden. Support Local News!

				Leen Yassine","September 24, 2025",Arts & Culture,NA,"BOWMANVILLE — It’s almost that time again: Block Club’s block party is back this October, featuring a lineup of Chicago DJs and performers. This year’s free block party is noon-9 p.m. Oct. 4 at Half Acre Beer Co., 2050 W. Balmoral Ave., in Lincoln Square. There’ll be live music, food, beer, local vendors, a kids zone and more — plus Block Club reporters, editors and staff will be on hand throughout the day. The lineup of performers is stacked with local performance groups like Wiggleworms and Jesse White Tumblers. The Cosmic Underground Theater will display its magic and mind-reading skills, and Somos Arte will offer crafts in the Kids Zone. Four local DJs will also be bringing their talents to the second annual event, spinning tunes throughout the day that reflect Chicago and their heritage. A post shared by Block Club Chicago (@blockclubchi) South Side native DJ SKOLi, born Ryan Roberts, has always been into music. Growing up in the Hyde Park area, he listened to a range of genres, he said. His mom was into funk, soul and R&B, his dad played jazz and blues and his cousins were into ’90s hip hop. “I just kind of realized one day that that’s something I’ve kind of done my whole life. I was always a real big music fan,” SKOLi told Block Club. “Once I started getting basically an allowance and working, that’s what I spent most of my money on: CDs, speakers, different equipment.” He started off as his family’s DJ, playing music at barbecues and other gatherings. He eventually booked his first gig while studying business at the University of Illinois in Champaign, he said. While working in sales and accounting after college, SKOLi traveled to work events in Las Vegas and Miami, which inspired him to lean into DJing more on the side. He also worked for Nike, and the company asked him to DJ their corporate events, he said. That was around 2015, when he realized he could make DJing his career, he said. “I was moving around a lot,” he said. “That kind of inspired me to focus on the DJing more too, because I saw such a big market all over the country for it. … It was a hobby just for a while.” Now, SKOLi plays sets across Chicago and beyond. He also has a monthly residency at Cafe Mustache, 2313 N. Milwaukee Ave. in Logan Square: SKOLi Moly Donut Shop, where he platforms other artists, hosts vendors and makes donuts for attendees. It takes place on the third Thursday of each month. A post shared by N.J. ✨ (@neva_diva1) SKOLi played at Block Club’s inaugural block party last year, which he said was “awesome.” “I had a great time,” he said. “The crowd was good, they were fun. It was a little bit of all ages and they were partying. They were very receptive to the things that I was doing and the other DJs and acts were doing.” When Block Club reached out again this year, “it was a no brainer,” he said. “I love being a part of it,” SKOLi said. “It was an honor.” Keep up with DJ SKOLi here. Northwest Side native Ignacio Ceja, also known as DJ IGGY, blends his heritage and his hometown into his music. He mixes his Mexican-American roots and Chicago sounds with global genres, from Norteña and Cumbia to house music to baile funk. IGGY was first inspired to DJ when he was around 9 years old, he told Block Club. “I have a cousin that used to DJ … house parties, and I would just come over to his house and watch him,” he said. “I just slowly started learning. I feel like I’ve always been a big fan of music, so it kind of came natural.” A post shared by DJ IGGY (@djiggy) While IGGY’s been DJing for many years now, he decided to pursue it full-time about three years ago, he said. He loves playing high-energy music that gets people dancing, and while he mostly plays nighttime and club events, he “loves reading a room” and playing all kinds of events. He also has a residency at Easy Does It, 2354 N. Milwaukee Ave., on the second Saturday of each month. He brings in local talent from in and around Chicago and hosts “one big dance party,” he said. “I would say I’m really into playing more club music … from Latin music to Brazilian music to Afrobeats, dance hall. … I just try to keep it fun and try to have people dancing and moving,” he said. “That really just brings me joy.” He’s looking forward to bringing that energy to the block party next month, he said. “It’s gonna be a fun set,” he said. “I plan to play some house, some edits, maybe music you’ve never heard before. … Honestly, just keeping the energy positive and hopefully I can have some people dancing on the dance floor.” Keep up with IGGY here. A post shared by Cam Be (@camovement) Film director, photographer, musician, DJ and music producer Cam Be is also on Block Club’s block party schedule. Blending soul, funk, hip-hop and gospel, Cam Be debuted his first solo album “7 Steps to 7” in 2018. It served as a soundtrack to his first solo photo exhibition, “So I Wrote Love in the Sky,” at Good Details Gallery in Chicago. He released his second album, “Summer in September,” in 2020. When spinning vinyl, his sets are rooted in “soul, hip-hop, funk, blues, gospel, African, Brazilian and rare groove traditions,” according to a post by Miyagi Records, where he’s performed sets. He crafts “sets that move both heart and feet,” the post reads. In addition to his music, Cam Be is an Emmy Award-winning producer, which he received while working with NBC Chicago, and has a feature-length documentary called “The Exchange” on Amazon Video. Cam Be is also a resident at the Green Line Performing Arts Center in Washington Park and is the owner and creative director of Camovement. Inspired by her stepfather’s and grandmother’s record collections, DJ Nosha Luv was immersed in music from a young age, according to her Resident Advisor biography. She got into the House scene under the mentorship of DJ Rush, or Isaiah Major — a musician, DJ and producer who’s made a name for himself in the Chicago house and techno scene. A post shared by Noshaluv Rime (@noshaluv) In 2007, Noshaluv curated a show called “Nice Night 4 A Jam,” which she curated with her then-husband Chris Ray and which she continues to host today. She then went on to learn how to DJ in the coming years, playing groovy sets that are meant to get people dancing, blending disco, boogie, soul and funk, according to her bio.

				Mack Liederman","September 24, 2025",Citywide,NA,"This is part our series of daily recaps of ICE activity in the Chicago region. Have a tip we should check out? Email newsroom@blockclubchi.org. BROADVIEW — Broadview officials are demanding that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement tear down a fence it erected around its facility after high-profile protests. Matthew J. Martin, the acting fire chief in suburban Broadview, wrote to a Department of Homeland Security official Tuesday that the fences were “illegally built” on a public street, blocking local firefighters from accessing businesses there in the case of an emergency. The fences, built overnight Tuesday, were not permitted, Martin wrote. “The Broadview Fire Department is reaching out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to demand that the fence be removed immediately,” Martin wrote in the short letter, which was reviewed by Block Club. Representatives for ICE, which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, did not return a request for comment. ICE put up the fencing as organizers have held regular demonstrations outside the building at 1930 Beach St. Friday’s protest became chaotic, with agents firing pepper balls, spraying tear gas and arresting and later releasing 10 people. Some organizers have called for daily protests in a bid to shut down the facility. The fencing extends across the street, keeping protesters away from the ICE building’s driveway. That stretch of Beach Street is largely home to construction suppliers. On Tuesday morning, about a half-dozen protesters stood near the fences on Beach Street, trying to figure out where to now gather. Federal agents paced the facility’s rooftop, with at least one carrying a pepper ball gun. The Associated Press reported that federal immigration agents had arrested almost 550 people by the end of last week as part of a ramped-up Chicago-area effort dubbed Operation Midway Blitz. Prior to the start of the operation, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson wrote to residents Sept. 2 that the local facility, where detainees are brought, may draw protests like those in Los Angeles, “where property damage and assaults against law enforcement were reported.” “As a result, we will be working closely with all businesses along Beach Drive to alert them to the possibility of traffic disruptions that may affect employees and deliveries over the next 45 to 60 days,”  Thompson wrote. Thompson later said she was largely ignored by Gov. JB Pritzker’s office when asking for help in dealing with crowd control near the ICE center. Thompson is scheduled to meet with Pritzker officials Wednesday, according to Capitol Fax. Colin Boyle contributed to this report. • Federal agents detained one person 8-9 a.m. Wednesday at 47th Street and Ashland Avenue, according to Southwest Rapid Response. • Federal agents detained two people 11:30 a.m.-noon Wednesday at the east Cicero Avenue entrance to I-55, according to Southwest Rapid Response. • Yuyo’s Fresh Market is offering free grocery delivery to Belmont Cragin residents who place an order of $50 or more 8 a.m.-5 p.m. in hopes “that this can be one less thing for you to worry about as we navigate these challenging days together,” according to a news release. • About 7 a.m. Wednesday, ICE cars were seen leaving the Comfort Inn, 133 E. Higgins Road in Schaumburg. You can follow these organizations for updates about immigration enforcement activity. Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/24/how-jeff-tweedys-musical-family-brought-his-new-triple-album-to-life/,How Jeff Tweedy’s Musical ‘Family’ Brought His New Triple Album To Life,"by
				Justin Curto",23 hours ago,Arts & Culture,NA,"CHICAGO — Besides his band Wilco, Jeff Tweedy’s most important musical collaborators are his family. Tweedy’s been performing with his elder son, Spencer, since 2014, when they released the joint album “Sukierae.” Jeff’s younger son, Sammy, and Spencer played on his 2018 solo album, “Warm.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tweedy took advantage of being at home with his two offspring musicians, performing on Instagram livestreams and recording an album, “Love Is the King,” together, which came out in 2020. For Tweedy’s new triple album “Twilight Override” — his fifth solo effort and first since “Love Is the King” — he wanted to expand his in-studio sound. So he also turned to the closest people he has next to kin: his touring band. “I can’t stress enough how wonderful it is to play music with your family,” Tweedy said, calling from a Wilco tour stop in Calgary, Canada. “And this is kind of an extended family, because I’ve known everybody since they were kids, pretty much, in this group.” Along with Spencer and Sammy, the band includes Liam Kazar, James Elkington, Sima Cunningham and Macie Stewart. Local rock fans may already be familiar with these names: Cunningham and Stewart perform as the experimental-rock band Finom, Kazar and Elkington are accomplished singer-songwriters, and Spencer Tweedy just released his first album with folk-rock band Case Oats. “Twilight Override” is out Friday. Jeff Tweedy and his band perform Nov. 1 at the Salt Shed, 1357 N. Elston Ave., with Macie Stewart opening solo. That lineup has been backing Tweedy since he returned to the road after the pandemic, but their connections run much deeper, he said. He has known Stewart and Kazar since 2012, when he produced “Traphouse Rock,” the debut album for their high school band Kids These Days — which also included a young Vic Mensa and Nico Segal. Kazar and Elkington started touring with Jeff and Spencer Tweedy in 2014, behind “Sukierae.” Cunningham, who is Kazar’s sister, eventually joined Tweedy’s solo band, and she later brought her bandmate Stewart into the lineup. Collaboration drives the musicians, who frequently appear on each other’s albums and at their concerts. “I grew up with Liam and Macie, and obviously my brother,” said Spencer Tweedy, who drummed on the album and played some synthesizers and piano. “It’s not just going out and hiring some session players or something. This is truly a group that has a language with each other.” Jeff Tweedy started writing the songs on “Twilight Override” to specifically fit the voices in the band. He was inspired by how the group “enhanced” the vocal harmonies of his songs live — especially with both male and female singers, unlike in Wilco. “I’ve always come home from those tours going, ‘Wow, I wish it sounded like that on the records,’” Tweedy said. But the musicians’ voices were only the first part of the equation. Their instrumental solos and improvisations brought the songs to life, adding an exploratory spirit that recalls Wilco’s early music. “It felt more like a jam session rather than, ‘All right, we have to get this take,’” said Stewart, who played violin, dolceola, synths and piano across the record. “[Jeff]’s never like, ‘No, I don’t like that idea. Stop doing that.’” Whether he’s performing with Wilco or as a solo artist, Tweedy prioritizes openness. He strived to create “an environment of experimentation and acceptance” during the band’s recording sessions at his Northwest Side studio, The Loft. “I don’t really like dictating,” Tweedy said. “I’d like to hear what somebody comes up with, because it’s going to be different than what I would come up with, and it’s going to be good. Sometimes it’s not going to be what I end up wanting to use, but I definitely want to hear it before I’ve inhibited it.” That approach paid off when the band was recording the song “Blank Baby.” Cunningham had been inspired by the bass part that Kazar was playing on the song. So Jeff decided to “pull the skeleton out of the song” by stripping it down to the bassline and rebuilding around that. The recording that resulted is meditative and grand, with Kazar’s bass counterbalancing ethereal strings and three-part harmony. The songs on the record frequently take surprising turns, like when the singsongy acoustic strummer “Out in the Dark” ends by crashing into a wall of electric guitar shredding. Tweedy wanted those “bizarre” moments to help break up the album’s 30-song runtime, he said. Just as often, though, the band members found themselves being surprised by the music they recorded. Stewart said “there was something different that would happen every time” they played the winding, six-minute highlight “One Tiny Flower.” “The most rewarding thing of all is the experience of hearing those things back, immediately,” Spencer Tweedy said. “We would do the songs and then be like, ‘How did this happen?’” Tweedy planned the project as a triple album from the beginning, hoping to push back against diminishing attention spans. He intentionally wanted it to be “slow and big and open” to reward listeners willing to spend th time with it. In all, Tweedy said the band probably recorded enough songs to fill five albums. He pared that down to the final track list, loosely organizing the songs into discs that represented past, present and future. “I kept listening to all of it and trying to get somebody to talk me out of making a triple record, and everybody I would play it for would get that that’s what it had to be,” Tweedy said. A post shared by Jeff Tweedy (@jefftweedy) There’s a bigger point to the album’s abundance, as well. In an essay accompanying “Twilight Override,” Tweedy wrote about embracing creativity as a counter to the “endless buffet” of darkness he sees in the world today. “When you align yourself with creation, you inherently take a side against destruction,” he wrote. To Tweedy, collaborating with his bandmates is another way to put that into practice. “It is a model behavior of the world I would like to see,” Tweedy said. “Sitting in a room together and playing a song and centering yourself in the present, and allowing something to happen that wouldn’t have happened otherwise, to make something that wasn’t there when you woke up that morning. All of that feels like, if you can do that, if you have the privilege to do that, I think you should.” “Twilight Overload” drops Friday on dBpm Records.

				Michael Liptrot",23 hours ago,"Austin, Garfield Park, North Lawndale",NA,"NEAR WEST SIDE — Popular rapper NBA YoungBoy’s United Center concert was abruptly canceled this week, seemingly over the threat of violence amid the artist’s beef with a Chicago rapper. Louisiana rapper NBA YoungBoy, also known as YoungBoy Never Broke Again, was set to perform Wednesday at the United Center as part of his national tour. But the United Center announced Tuesday it was canceling the show, upsetting some fans who were given only a day’s notice — while others said it was for the best due to concerns about violence because of NBA YoungBoy’s feud with Chicago rapper Lil Durk. “So inconsiderate, [there’s] people who took off work, booked flights, hotels … spent their last to go to this concert,” one online user wrote in the comments on the United Center’s announcement. “Business owners in this city who were booked depending on the tour to make money and now they are losing money.” The United Center did not provide a reason for the cancellation in its announcement. A spokesperson declined to comment. But fans, a rap expert and the performer’s own mother said the cancellation was likely done to prevent violence. Several of NBA YoungBoy’s tour stops have seen fights inside of venues, including in Los Angeles and Kansas City. Wednesday’s show would have been NBA YoungBoy’s first performance in Chicago in five years following legal battles and the slaying of King Von, which heightened a beef between YoungBoy and Lil Durk. King Von was killed in Atlanta in 2020 following a skirmish with the crew of rapper Quando Rondo, who is an associate of NBA YoungBoy, according to media reports. The killing intensified the beef between YoungBoy and Durk, who is in jail awaiting trial in an alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill Quando Rondo following King Von’s death. At a Sept. 6 show in Houston, YoungBoy dissed Durk. During YoungBoy’s Kansas City show, the energy was so crazy a fight even broke out in the crowd! The vibe was nonstop chaos and hype all night. 💥” Fun Facts / Highlights: 	1.	“Security had to step in quick, but the show never slowed down.” 	2.	“Fans said this was one of the rowdiest shows of the M.A.S.A. Tour so far.” #NBAYoungBoy #MASATour #youngboyneverbrokeagain #nbayoungboyconcert #tmobilearena Given that YoungBoy has antagonized associates of local rappers Durk and King Von, the show’s cancellation might be chalked up to preemptive conflict aversion, said Jabari M. Evans, assistant professor of race and media at the University of South Carolina and a Chicago rapper known as Naledge. “It’s a public safety issue to have that many people in a venue and to know that there’s a level of contention that could go to a level of violence,” Evans said. “It may be preemptive to a certain degree.” It would not be the first time the United Center has canceled a show due to concerns about violence: A 2023 Lil Durk show at the United Center was called off due to false reports of gun shots. And before canceling NBA YoungBoy’s performance, the United Center had announced a strict “no bag” policy for the show, forbidding all bags. The policy irked some fans, who mentioned in social media comments that the policy was not instituted for other recent, non-hip hop shows at the United Center, including Lorde’s and Dua Lipa’s. But fans were divided in their reactions to the cancellation. “They really hated on NBA YoungBoy. They made sure he didn’t perform in Chicago,” one person wrote in the comments of the United Center’s announcement. Other fans said the move was warranted given the recent violence at the rapper’s concerts. “They made the right move,” another social media user wrote. “I don’t think YoungBoy would’ve got hurt, but for the fans and other people, there may have been some drama.” The rapper’s manager, Alex Junnier, seemingly criticized the cancellation on social media, writing that the United Center “b—-ed out.” But the mother of NBA YoungBoy, real name Kentrell Gaulden, took to social media Tuesday afternoon to address the outcry. “It wasn’t canceled to hurt y’all, it was canceled to protect y’all,” Sherhonda Gaulden said.

				Melody Mercado",7 hours ago,Downtown,NA,"WEST LOOP — A popular Indian restaurant hopes to make a splash as it opens a third location in Fulton Market’s Restaurant Row with a new executive chef and an updated menu. Co-owners Vikram and Agnes Singh opened Kama Bistro in suburban LaGrange in 2009. After experiencing significant success, they decided to open another smaller location in Wicker Park in 2023. Now, the duo beat significant competition for a prime location at 812 W. Randolph St., the Singhs said. Kama opens Oct. 2. “It’s an obvious draw for anyone who wants to push themselves,” Vikram Singh said. The restaurant tapped chef Esteban Nuñez, who previously worked at Michelin-starred Alinea and Roister, to raise the bar on technique and creativity, they said. Nuñez brings nearly a decade of experience to an entirely new kitchen staff at the West Loop location. Kama’s West Loop menu will be different than the other two locations, keeping some of the classics while adding items from Nuñez. Nuñez has introduced vegetarian and globally inspired dishes, including blistered okra and shishito peppers in mustard chili oil with cumin tahini, roasted eggplant with fennel and cauliflower puree, and lamb ragu seasoned with Indian spices over rice noodles. He also updated a classic: short rib nihari, traditionally made with lamb shank. “This guy is a beast. … I love that passion. I want him to think like an owner. That’s the structure I’m creating for him as a young guy. He’s very talented,” Vikram Singh said. Agnes Singh, who also manages Kama’s bar program, said she’s excited to lean into Nuñez’s talents to expand the cocktail menu. The bar prioritizes infused syrups made in-house with Indian spices like black and green cardamom. Agnes Singh said she’s workshopping a playful apricot element for the cocktail menu, which includes a house-made apricot jelly coated in Pop Rocks, designed to be part of a spritz cocktail. The restaurant’s interior design was mostly done by hand thanks to Agnes Singh, who devised a complex wall finish she dubbed “Agnes technique.” The extensive process required “stage after stage after stage” of layering stencils, clay, paint and sponging, she said. The technique draws inspiration from Indian henna patterns and is featured across most of the walls. The restaurant also features two large murals by contemporary fine artist and muralist Jenny Vyas. Other features include marble bar tops and handmade wooden tables from Poland and hanging metal lamps from Morocco. The spot is a true “global effort,” Vikram Singh said. Here are other restaurants and food shops that have opened or are planning to open Downtown and in the West Loop: ÍLA’S, a New American restaurant from restaurateur Kirtan Gandhi, is now open at 15 W. Hubbard St. in River North. Named after Gandhi’s mother, the restaurant offers comfort food with international flair, featuring dishes such as birria pierogi, short rib “Italian” beef and sweet corn agnolotti. According to the restaurant’s website, the concept was inspired by Gandhi’s mother’s kitchen and her love of sharing food. The space is designed to have a warm, homey atmosphere — ideal for lingering conversations — while serving globally influenced comfort fare. Gandhi, who also owns Evergreen Park’s Porter Cullens, said he envisioned ÍLA’S as a community gathering spot focused on genuine hospitality. “ÍLA’S is really about a return to genuine hospitality,” he said, adding that he wants customers to “hang out, stay a while and just enjoy yourself.” The menu includes starters such as lumpia egg rolls, paneer kabobs and wood-fired scallops, along with handhelds, pastas and fish entrees. A “dinner for two” section highlights an $85 20-ounce bone-in ribeye, $40 porchetta and a $35 roasted half-chicken. The restaurant’s happy hour, which runs 3-6 p.m. Monday-Friday, features $11 cocktails, $10 house wine, $7 draft beers and $12 bites. ÍLA’S serves lunch and dinner, with plans to add brunch soon. Gandhi said his goal is simple: “Whether it’s the food, the service, the cocktails or just the company they shared, an experience at ÍLA’S should simply make you feel good.” ÍLA’S, 15 W. Hubbard St., is open 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Sunday-Wednesday and 11 a.m.-noon Thursday-Saturday. The first standalone location of The Cookie Bar by Summer House is open in Streeterville. Located at 161 E. Huron St., Cookie Bar is branching out from being a fixture inside the popular Lincoln Park restaurant Summer House Santa Monica. The shop will offer a selection of signature Summer House cookies, plus seasonal specials made by Juan Gutierrez, Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants’ corporate pastry chef. Flavors include chocolate chip, raspberry cheesecake, birthday cake and a vegan and gluten-free chocolate chip. The Cookie Bar will offer soft-serve available in a cone or cup in vanilla, chocolate and swirl flavors. Toppings include housemade hot fudge, rainbow sprinkles and mini chocolate chips. Cookie Bar also has coffee from La Colombe. Cooke Bar is open 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday-Friday and noon-7 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. Beloved South Side ice cream shop Rainbow Cone is opening a storefront at 163 N. Michigan Ave. on Monday, a spokesperson confirmed in an email to Block Club. The Beverly-based brand known for its five-layer cones has teased passersby with colorful signs on the storefront, which used to be a Protein Bar. Rainbow Cone’s iconic treat has five signature flavors: orange sherbet, pistachio, Palmer House, strawberry and chocolate, with the ice cream famously sliced, not scooped. The 99-year-old company has been opening and franchising locations in the Chicago area and across the country since its 2019 merger with Buona Beef. Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao, a famous New York City soup dumpling chain, is opening its first location in Chicago. The restaurant plans to set up shop at 609 N. Dearborn St. in River North, according to a listing on its website. Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao, which opened in Flushing, New York in 2006, has been Michelin-recommended for its soup dumplings and Shanghainese cuisine, though it has not received a star. Soup dumplings on its menu include truffle and pork, crab meat and pork and abalone and pork. The restaurant also serves noodles, dim sum and stir fries. No opening date has been announced for the Chicago location. Vancouver-based restaurant Moxies is expanding to the Gold Coast, according to a press release. The restaurant is described as “upscale casual” and will take over 13,600 square feet as an anchor tenant for Newberry on the Triangle, a commercial redevelopment at 1030 N. State St. The restaurant chain was founded in 1986 and has about 60 locations. Its menu features steak and seafood, ribs, chicken dishes, pasta bowls, salads, burgers and appetizers, with an emphasis on housemade ingredients and signature cocktails. The new Gold Coast location is part of the brand’s push to add more franchise locations. Moxies is estimated to open in the spring. Support Local News!

				Ariel Parrella-Aureli","September 24, 2025","Logan Square, Humboldt Park, Avondale",NA,"LOGAN SQUARE — After a crowdfunding campaign, a full interior overhaul and rummaging through a ton of sports memorabilia, a highly-anticipated women’s sports bar is now open in Logan Square. Babe’s Sports Bar at 3017 W. Armitage Ave. had a soft opening Saturday after nearly a year of renovations, creating a space for fans of women’s professional sports, said bar owner Nora McConnell-Johnson. “This is a market that’s underserved, and I feel like that’s been fully shown, which is great, and proves the point that when you give access and opportunity for women’s sports or women-specific things, the demand is there,” McConnell-Johnson. “It’s about the importance of equity in our spaces and our city life.” A lifelong athlete and sports fan, McConnell-Johnson, of Humboldt Park, has been on a mission to open up Babe’s since last year, jumping through zoning and building issues and gaining community feedback and money through a crowdfunding campaign that helped outfit the space. McConnell-Johnson raised $75,000 for the bar, which is decked out in green and pink and features colorful lights, red trim and disco balls in the bathrooms, which have their own Instagram account for patron selfies. Babe’s owners gutted the previous space to make room for a new bar counter, an improved patio, fresh wallpaper, a photo booth and, soon, bleachers. When installed, the bleachers will fit 12 people and sit next to a vintage scoreboard from an old recreation center in Illinois. People who donated $1,000 to get Babe’s off the ground received a personal brass nameplate along the bar as a public thank-you. Those who donated $500 received Babe’s merch and access to a VIP-only opening party this past weekend before the official grand opening this Saturday. Throughout the space, pictures and sports memorabilia of women in action are on display, including tables that feature old sports photos, pins and varsity jacket letters. Donated trophies line the walls, including one from McConnell-Johnson when she coached rugby. “I want people to see themselves in the space, whether it’s actually themselves or a nod to women and women’s sports history,” she said. “Women’s sports fans deserve the world, and this is our attempt to try and give them something great.” With eight televisions, Babe’s is able to show four women’s sports games at the same time, curated to what viewers want to see. Events, sports-related movie screenings and watch parties are also being planned. But don’t go to Babe’s expecting to watch men’s sports, McConnell-Johnson said. For those wanting to get more into professional women’s sports, the bar team plans to host info sessions prior to each game called Between Periods. McConnell-Johnson and her friend, Shana Sumers, will offer attendees a crash course on the players and rules of the game they’re about to watch. The bar’s opening — intended to happen in time for March Madness — took longer than expected, but the timing still works out with WNBA playoffs starting this week. Babe’s will show the playoffs this week during its soft launch. Saturday’s grand opening will feature appearances by local athletes who supported the bar, including members of Chicago’s women’s soccer team Stars FC, the Sky and the Chicago Winds, a new women’s football league. The bar will also host a special guest bartending spot with the Stars’ goalie, Alyssa Naeher, and defender Sam Staab 7-9 p.m. Oct. 2. Bar manager Margaux Lent spent months perfecting cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks for the Babe’s menu in her Avondale apartment; bringing “my babies” to the masses is an exciting step, Lent said. The drink menu features wine, cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks, which are made with freshly squeezed juices, syrups made in-house and Prosecco on tap. Patrons can expect a chile margarita with passionfruit nectar syrup, a martini and negroni with Prosecco — a new kind of negroni for a new kind of sports bar, said the owner. There’s beer too, of course. “If you’re watching a game and you’ve got to get back to it, we wanted to have ease of service for not only the bartenders but the patrons, too,” Lent said. Babe’s takes over the former Music Lounge space, which has sat vacant for more than seven years. It is one of a few new businesses on the Armitage Avenue corner: Omakase Box opened across the street in July. Its colorful design, which flows from the bar wallpaper to the photo booth to the bathrooms and even outside to the fence mural — all designed by women — aims to invite new people to the women’s sports world and create a community for those who’ve been missing one, McConnell-Johnson said. “So many people say, ‘Well, I’m not a sports fan because X, Y and Z,’ but if you have the ability to be, you would be,” she said. “I feel like that’s one of the things we do here that’s going to be really powerful, is create the on ramp for people. That’s gonna make it better for everybody and is huge for women’s sports.” Babe’s is open 4-midnight Tuesday-Friday and noon-midnight Saturday-Sunday. Support Local News!

				Molly DeVore","September 23, 2025",Citywide,NA,"This is part of our series of daily recaps of ICE activity in the Chicago region. Have a tip we should check out? Email newsroom@blockclubchi.org. FRANKLIN PARK — Federal immigration agents fatally shot a man in suburban Franklin Park after they said the man drove his car at them, dragging an officer and causing him to fear for his life, officials said at the time. But body camera footage obtained by the Sun-Times shows a federal agent who was involved in the Sept. 12 fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas González tell police his injuries obtained during the incident were “nothing major.” The footage, which the Sun-Times got from the Franklin Park Police Department through a public records request, shows an ICE agent tell a Franklin Park cop that Villegas González tried to run him and his partner over. In the video, the agent’s partner is seen with a bloodied knee. According to the Sun-Times, the agent told police that he was “dragged a little bit.” Later, the video shows the ICE agent who said Villegas González tried to run him and his partner over speaking over a radio. The agent said his partner had “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands.” The injured agent said “nothing major” and his partner repeated “nothing major” into the radio, according to the Sun-Times. The fatal shooting happened the morning of Sept. 12 near a Franklin Park intersection, where officers tried to stop Villegas González. A few hours after the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that said ICE agents stopped Villegas González, who “refused to follow law enforcements commands and drove his car at law enforcement officers. One of the ICE officers was hit by the car and dragged a significant distance.” “The officer sustained multiple injuries and is in stable condition,” the statement said. According to the body cam footage and a Franklin Park police report obtained by Block Club, officers spoke to a truck driver who said he saw Villegas González reverse his car as ICE agents tried to arrest him. The truck driver said Villegas González lost control and crashed into his truck. He told police he heard at least one gunshot, according to the Sun-Times. ICE agents involved in the fatal shooting were not wearing body cameras during the incident, the Sun-Times reported last week. The Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago confirmed that Villegas González was a Mexican national. State Rep. Norma Hernandez said the 38-year-old was the father of two young sons, a 7-year-old and a 3-year-old, and was his family’s sole provider. The shooting happened shortly after he dropped his children off at school, Hernandez said. A GoFundMe has been set up for Villegas González’s family and has raised nearly $58,000 as of Tuesday. Last week, Gov. JB Pritzker called for an investigation into the shooting, a sentiment Mayor Brandon Johnson echoed during a press event Tuesday. “This was a tragedy. And a father, a worker, a human being, their life was taken from us because of this ungodly leadership at the federal level,” Johnson said. “I believe what’s necessary in this moment is that the federal government has a responsibility to check the behavior and the activity of law enforcement, and so it could be appropriate for the Department of Justice to establish an independent investigation outside of itself.” Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/24/new-ordinance-would-allow-chicago-restaurants-to-opt-in-as-dog-friendly/,New Ordinance Would Allow Chicago Restaurants To Opt In As ‘Dog-Friendly’,"by
				Patrick Filbin","September 24, 2025",City Hall,NA,"LINCOLN PARK — Chicago restaurants could soon have the option to allow dogs indoors under a new ordinance that will be pitched to the City Council this week. Ald. Timmy Knudsen (43rd) is introducing an ordinance that would let restaurant owners choose to allow dogs inside their businesses. Knudsen said the idea is aimed at giving small businesses more flexibility and dog owners more freedom to stop in a coffee shop or restaurant while on a walk with their four-legged friends. The measure, which goes before City Council on Thursday, would overhaul city code that currently bans dogs from retail food establishments, except for service animals. Restaurants that want to participate could register as “dog-friendly” businesses by posting signs at their entrances and following a set of health and safety rules. Under current city law, restaurants can’t allow dogs inside unless the animal is a service dog, and dogs are only allowed on patios if the business in question chooses to allow it. In practice, though, plenty of places bend the rules. Enforcement usually comes only if someone files a complaint, leaving business owners vulnerable to surprise inspections and possible fines. Knudsen’s proposal was partly inspired by Sophie Evanoff, owner of Lincoln Park’s Vanille Patisserie at 2108 N. Clark St. Evanoff was hit with multiple health inspections after patrons reported dogs inside her shop, and those inspections eat up hours of a business owner’s time and add stress, Knudsen said. “It’s usually several hours on the phone, a lot of preparation goes in and really puts business owners on edge,” Knudsen told Block Club. “We all know that a lot of businesses have been turning a blind eye to this for a while, but why isn’t there an option?” Knudsen worked with the Chicago Department of Public Health and other small businesses to craft a compromise: Let restaurants opt in, but only if they follow a rule book. Stipulations in the proposed ordinance include only one dog per patron, dogs must be on a leash at all times and canine friends must have proof of their rabies vaccination, among others. Dogs won’t be allowed near kitchens or food prep areas, can’t be fed inside and cannot come into contact with plates, utensils or surfaces under the proposed measure. Employees of these restaurants, no matter how friendly the four-legged friends are, are not allowed to pet or touch the dogs while working with food, per the ordinance. Businesses that opt in would need to use washable surfaces for tables and floors and report any dog bites to 311. Violations could bring fines ranging from $200 to $1,000 per offense, and repeat violations could trigger license suspension. “I do want to stress that the ordinance is only for businesses that really want to sign up for this,” Knudsen said. “At an extreme, I’ve heard people ask, ‘You’re going to require that a dog can be sat next to me at Alinea?’ That’s just not the case. There are certain restaurants that would never consider opting into this. But they don’t have to.” Knudsen said he sees the measure as not just helping restaurants but also strengthening neighborhoods. Allowing dog owners to spend more time with their pets at local cafes encourages pet ownership, safer communities and local businesses, he said. “For me, it gives business owners the power to run their business and market their business as they want to,” he said. “I think that’s a really powerful thing at a time when businesses are mostly having requirements put on them.” The city’s Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and the Department of Public Health would enforce the rules. If passed, the changes would take effect 90 days after approval. Knudsen said he’s already gotten early support from colleagues and restaurant industry leaders, but he’s open to adjustments if issues come up. “If there is opposition, I’m someone who wants to make ordinances that work,” he said. “We can never make things work for everybody, but if there are unintended consequences, we can make sure they’re fixed by the process of talking to colleagues, advocacy groups and other groups who might be affected.” Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/23/chicago-fire-stadium-at-the-78-south-side-hotels-get-key-zoning-approvals/,"Chicago Fire Stadium At The 78, South Side Hotels Get Key Zoning Approvals","by
				Quinn Myers","September 23, 2025",City Hall,NA,"CITY HALL — A sweeping proposal to build a Chicago Fire soccer stadium at the South Loop site known as The 78 was advanced by a key City Council committee on Tuesday. The council’s zoning committee approved a rezoning for the privately funded, 22,000-seat stadium, which is backed by the Fire and development firm Related Midwest. It will serve as a key attraction for the $8 billion megadevelopment. The project must still be approved by the full City Council, which meets Thursday. Plans for The 78 have changed multiple times since the first renderings were released five years ago; a research and teaching facility from Discovery Partners Institute was scrapped last year after the group pulled out in favor of an alternate site on the Far South Side. A plan for adding a Red Line stop at 15th and Clark Street was also nixed. With the stadium proposal in the works, developers are now proposing a dedicated bus route and a water taxi station. The current planned development at The 78 will allow the construction of up to 10,000 residential units on the site, although Related Midwest President Curt Bailey told alderpeople on Tuesday it likely won’t quite reach that number. “I think we’ll probably end up a little bit lower than that, just based on … how we’re going to build it, how tall we can build, because we’re now doing a stadium. But I think it’s going to be much more attractive to people who live there, with a stadium there,” he said. Bailey said Related Midwest plans to build the required 20 percent of affordable units on site. Fire owner Joe Mansueto has said he hopes the soccer stadium will open in 2028. The $650 million project will have limited on-site parking, development representatives said at a recent community meeting. Between on-site parking and the use of nearby lots and garages, there will be 2,800-3,000 parking spaces available on Fire game days. Shuttle services are planned for fans using off-site parking facilities. Alderpeople praised the plan at Tuesday’s zoning meeting, with many thanking Mansueto for investing in the city with his own money. “This is an incredibly impactful project for the city of Chicago and frankly our local economy,” Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd) said. “We do not see nearly enough tower cranes, and thank God for this one.” Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), whose ward includes the site, is also supporting the project, which she said went through nine community meetings to garner neighborhood feedback. Dowell’s also continuing to push for additional infrastructure changes to ease congestion around the proposed stadium. “We’re looking at additional pedestrian pathways on the southern section of the site to enhance people being able to access this beautiful location, and we’re exploring increased public access and traffic calming along Clark Street,” Dowell said. The South Loop and Bronzeville alderperson made a passing reference to previous reports that the White Sox considered building a stadium at The 78. “We’ve also got a commitment and language in the [planned development agreement] to ensure that only one stadium can be constructed on the site,” Dowell said. Plans for a 250-room hotel that would be across the street from Jackson Park and about a block from the future Obama Presidential Center won unanimous approval from the zoning committee Tuesday. Aquinnah Investment Trust plans to build the hotel at 6402-6420 S. Stony Island Ave. in Woodlawn. In addition to the hotel rooms, the developer plans to add shops, offices and 118 car parking spaces, zoning documents show. The 303-foot-tall building would feature a fifth-floor swimming pool and outdoor terraces. Aquinnah owns three parcels at the proposed site, while the other two are city-owned. The city intends to sell its properties to the developer “at fair market value,” planning department Commissioner Ciere Boatright wrote in a letter to Plan Commission officials in January. The proposal has gotten pushback from housing activists, who have called on city leaders to prioritize long-stalled housing protections for residents near the Obama Center over approving the hotel. A 51-unit apartment building and 125-room hotel complex on the same block as the XS Tennis facility in Washington Park was OK’d by the zoning committee on Tuesday. The site at 5301-25 S. State St. is owned by XS Tennis founder and President Kamau Murray, who is also spearheading the development. The five-story apartment building would be almost entirely earmarked as affordable, and it would include indoor pickleball courts, a café and 24 off-street parking spaces. “I want to point out of the 51 proposed residential units, 50 are going to be rented at an affordable rate. It’s in working partnership with the Department of Housing and some other programs with the city that we’re able to offer that,” zoning attorney Nicholas Ftikas said Tuesday. The six-story hotel would include a 2,040-square-foot commercial space and 48 parking spaces, according to project renderings. Murray opened the $9.8 million XS Tennis facility in 2018. The tennis center was built on land that was once part of the high-rise Robert Taylor Homes public housing project, which stretched for 2 miles along State Street. The buildings were razed in 2007. Following a growing post-pandemic trend in Chicago and elsewhere, another Downtown building plans to convert vacant office space into residential units. A Chicago landmark known for its art deco design, the Pittsfield Building, 55 E. Washington St., is in the midst of an overhaul and restoration by owner Tom Liravongsa. Liravongsa has been documenting his process as Skyscraper Guy on Instagram, where his videos have racked up millions of views. The zoning committee greenlit the plan to convert unused office space in the building into 214 residential units, which will come on top of the 228 apartments already there. The redevelopment “would retrofit the building, including repairing the facade. There’s been a scaffolding around Washington and Wabash surrounding this building for about a decade,” zoning attorney Rolando Acosta told alderpeople Tuesday. Plans for the rehabilitation also call for adding a four-story observation deck at the top of the building, including a cafe and bar on the 37th floor. The zoning committee on Tuesday also approved plans for a 32-unit apartment building in Avondale, a 40-unit building for the former Stage 773 Theater in Lakeview and numerous other projects. All zoning changes must still be approved by the full City Council. Block Club’s Jamie Nesbitt Golden and Maxwell Evans contributed. Support Local News!

				Quinn Myers","September 23, 2025",City Hall,NA,"CITY HALL — A proposal to allow additional dwelling units such as coach houses and basement units to be built citywide appears likely to pass City Council this week after alderpeople added additional restrictions to the legislation. The compromise ordinance that was made public Tuesday is the latest version of a plan first proposed more than two years ago by Ald. Bennett Lawson (44th) to allow additional dwelling units to be built across the city without requiring a zoning change. The ordinance builds off a limited pilot program established in 2021 that allowed additional dwelling unit construction in five pilot areas on the North, Northwest, West, South and Southeast sides. Coach houses and other “conversion units,” such as basement apartments, qualify as additional dwelling units. Backers argue that ADUs are a relatively simple way to boost density and affordable housing across Chicago. An expansion of the system is one recommendation in Mayor Brandon Johnson’s Cut The Tape initiative that aims to streamline development in the city. Southwest Side Ald. Marty Quinn (13th) and other critics, however, have raised concerns that the increase in density would harm the character of single-family neighborhoods and allow development without city oversight. Quinn planned to introduce his own ordinance this month to restrict construction of such units in single-family districts, among other stipulations. But with a final vote slated for Thursday’s full City Council meeting, Quinn and Lawson struck a last-minute deal on the legislation they both said appeases their concerns. The final ordinance would still allow additional dwelling units to be built without a zoning change in areas zoned for multi-unit buildings, as well as business and commercial districts. One major change is that single-family districts not included in the original pilot zones will not be allowed to build the additional dwelling units under the expansion unless individual alderpeople decide to “opt-in” through a separate ordinance for part or all of an impacted area. “We put my ordinance and Ald. Quinn’s ordinance together to reach a compromise where we are putting together an extension of the pilot zones for single-family homes,” Lawson said Tuesday. “So all the zones that are in [the pilot areas] stay, and other zones can be added by ordinance, in consultation with the local alderman.” The additional dwelling unit ordinance is expected to be voted on at Thursday’s full City Council meeting. Lawson’s earlier version was advanced by the council’s zoning committee in July. Other restrictions on construction of the additional units that were part of earlier proposals are also included in the latest version. Under the proposed ordinance, one additional dwelling unit would be allowed per block every year in residential districts zoned RS-1; two would be allowed per block in districts zoned RS-2; and three allowed in districts zoned RS-3. Homeowners will also be required to live in the detached house where they are seeking to build an additional unit, regardless of which type of zoning district it falls in. On top of those limits, the new legislation will require contractors building new coach houses to participate in a U.S. Department of Labor apprenticeship program — a stipulation supported by organized labor leaders, Bob Reiter, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, said in a press release. Quinn — who won many of his sought-after concessions in the latest ordinance— also praised the legislation. “I can stand by an ordinance that encourages local hiring and fair wage standards, a point that resonates strongly with Chicago’s labor community. I appreciate Ald. Lawson’s collaboration and partnership to move this ordinance forward,” Quinn said in a statement. Support Local News!

				Colin Boyle","September 23, 2025",Citywide,NA,"BROADVIEW — Officials have put up high fencing around the ICE facility in suburban Broadview after days of protests there. The fencing was put up overnight, one witness said. For weeks, activists have protested outside the facility, determined to resist ramped-up federal immigration enforcement activities. Federal agents have used non-lethal force on peaceful gatherings. As of 7:30 a.m. Tuesday, roughly half a dozen protesters gathered near the fenced-off building as they tried to figure out a new protest point. Activists are planning daily protests at the facility in an effort to shut it down. “How can you NAZI what they are doing?” one person’s sign read. Federal agents continued to pace the rooftop of the processing facility, with at least one holding a large pepper ball gun. A large party bus drove into the secured parking lot of the facility after 6:30 a.m. Vehicles are only able to exit and enter from adjacent Harvard Street, which may create a new point of tension between guards and protesters at the facility. At Lexington and Beach streets, Broadview police offers were directing traffic Tuesday morning as barricades were being placed to block Beach Street. Support Local News!

				Shreya Srinivasan",22 hours ago,Downtown,NA,"DOWNTOWN — Chicago is looking for the perfect tree to take center stage during Downtown’s holiday festivities — and it could be yours. Residents have until Oct. 14 to submit their tree to be the official Millennium Park Christmas tree, according to a city news release. The chosen tree will be removed and moved to the park, where it will be decorated and lit up during the annual tree-lighting ceremony in November. This year’s tree will remain lit until Jan. 11. All submitted trees must be 45 feet or taller. Norway spruce or Fir trees located within 15 miles of The Loop are preferred, although trees within 50 miles will be considered. Pine trees are ineligible as they’re not sturdy enough. Those interested can email dcase@cityofchicago.org with photos and information about the owner and tree. “The Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony is one of Chicago’s most beloved holiday traditions, bringing communities and visitors from around the world together in celebration,” events department Commissioner Clinée Hedspeth said in the news release. Last year’s tree came from the Holden-Shaddick family of Logan Square. The tree-lighting ceremony is 6 p.m. Nov. 21. Other iconic Chicago holiday traditions such as ice skating at McCormick Tribune Ice Rink and the Millennium Park Holiday Market will also open Nov. 21. Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/24/private-fences-put-up-around-public-park-irks-near-north-neighbors/,Private Fences Put Up Around Public Park Irk Near North Neighbors,"by
				Mack Liederman","September 24, 2025",Downtown,NA,"NEAR NORTH SIDE — Michele Dreczynski has fond memories of her son riding bikes through the park by her riverside townhouse “completely free and untethered.” That was before the park — with city-mandated public hours — was fenced in by her homeowner association. Metal gates at River Village North Townhomes, 1005 N. Kingsbury St., have gone up near West Hobbie and Oak streets, completing the fencing around the small, manicured park along the Near North Side riverwalk. The park must be publicly accessible 6 a.m.-11 p.m. daily as part of an agreement with the city — but in February, inspectors with the city’s Department of Planning “found locked gates and unlawful signage” on the park’s riverwalk side, where fences have been up for a decade, department spokesman Peter Strazzabosco said in a statement. The association recently added signs on the gates with public hours. The park passed a similar inspection this month, Strazzabosco said. But Dreczynski thinks the fences make the park feel closed off to everyone else in Chicago. She said she didn’t sign up to live in a gated community. “It’s all to give the appearance of a private park,” Dreczynski said. “There’s an old saying: ‘Fences make bad neighbors.'” Next to the gates with the public park signs are new intercom systems with dial pads and an after-hours access code for residents. A larger sign on a stake prominently reads “No Trespassing.” An executive at First Community Management, representing the homeowners’ association, said it had no comment. But association President John Courtney pitched residents on the six-figure fences as a safety precaution, according to a letter from last year reviewed by Block Club. “The need for enhanced security became especially urgent in May 2021, following theChicago riots, when crime and burglary spiked in the area, including break-ins or attempted break-ins in some of our units, as well as a significant increase in package theft,” Courtney wrote. “We’ve also had productive discussions among neighbors regarding the pros and cons of installing gates.” There were no riots in Chicago in May of 2021, so it is unclear what Courtney is referring to. Courtney wrote the fences could raise property values for River Village residents with 24-hour park access and provide “increased privacy.” Some of the townhomes have doors with small yards leading directly into the park. He estimated the fences would cost $160,000. That would run homeowners $1,200-$3,000 each, which they could repay monthly over nine years with interest. The fences had to be approved by at least 51 percent of homeowners, Courtney wrote. “Some residents were concerned about restricted access for non-residents to enjoy the park,” Courtney wrote of the cons. “We’ve addressed this by agreeing to keep the park open during Chicago Park hours.” The new fences on West Hobbie and Oak streets enclose the park, which had gates on its riverwalk and North Crosby street sides installed by the homeowner association about a decade ago, said Eric Gierzynski, a longtime River Village resident and former board member of the homeowner association. It wasn’t until June that Gierzynski noticed the gates regularly open during public park hours, he said. The tour boat captain takes his Australian cattle dog, Juniper, for daily walks in the park. “By putting up the gates, everyone will think it’s sealed off,” Gierzynski said. “It’s been a slow encroachment. … This is the latest round of this.” Caroline Sachay, who lives in a neighboring building and has long enjoyed the park with her poodle, Lakota, called the new fences “a bummer,” “super ugly” and “a waste of money.” “It reminds me of Trump building his wall,” Sachay said. “It’s another reminder of people giving into their fears.” Neighbor Kathi Toll joked that the park is both “oasis” and “prison” as she took Brioche, her Pomeranian, for a stroll. “They’re very formidable,” Toll said of the fences. “I don’t think we have the type of foot traffic that warrants something like that.” Barbara Lancaster said her cockapoo, River, has made friends on their walks around the park. So has she. “The people who own dogs know they can come here,” Lancaster said. “But for so many years, they let people think it was private. Why trust them not to do that now?” Other dog walkers milling around the sleepy park on a recent Monday said they didn’t want to get involved in the neighborhood kerfuffle. Dreczynski said the decade-long debate over fences has “divided the community.” Courtney wrote in the June 2024 letter the project had been “under discussion for some time.” “As crime rates fluctuate, as is expected in a large city, and with some residents moving to the suburbs, opinions on the gate project will continue to change,” Courtney said. But Gierzynski said he made up his mind a long time ago. “I’ll give the board members dirty looks,” Gierzynski said. “The world is better when spaces benefit everybody.” Dreczynski moved in when the townhomes were built in the early 2000s. Back then, the area was largely part of the Cabrini-Green public housing high-rises, which were all demolished by 2011. “The people who moved here had much more of a pioneer spirit,” Dreczynski said. “As buildings were torn down and people were displaced from the [Chicago Housing Authority], there was zero understanding of what people were moving into. Over time, I’ve seen gates locked and spaces become privatized.” River Village is considered a Planned Development, a zoning category dating back to 1988. It was designed to open up the North Branch of the Chicago River to residential and mixed-use developments, transforming it from a declining industrial hub. Planned Developments must be “compatible with the character of existing neighborhoods” and “encourage the protection and conservation of the city’s natural resources,” according to the city. The documents spell out pages upon pages of public benefits, like the requirement River Village keep its park open during typical city park hours. Dreczynski considers herself a watchful eye. “Take the casino development; what if they say, ‘Nobody can now go on its part of the riverwalk’?” Dreczynski said. “There must be integrity to the rules that garner a [Planned Development]. These aren’t small changes.” Her son is off to college. Now she walks the park with a beagle, Milo. “My goal is to make sure every park sign stays up on every gate,” Dreczynski said. “It’s still too hard to open the darn gates.” Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/23/cooley-high-marks-50-years-as-coming-of-age-classic-uplifting-chicagos-black-communities/,‘Cooley High’ Marks 50 Years As Coming-Of-Age Classic Uplifting Chicago’s Black Communities,"by
				Atavia Reed","September 23, 2025",Arts & Culture,NA,"ENGLEWOOD  — When “Cooley High” was released in 1975, the scrappy cast and crew had no idea they were creating a coming-of-age classic. The film follows best friends and protagonists Leroy “Preach” Jackson (Glynn Turman) and Richard “Cochise” Morris (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) who live in housing projects on Chicago’s Near North Side. Over the course of a few days in 1964, they and their pals tease gorillas at Lincoln Park Zoo, play basketball on North Clybourn Avenue, visit a diner at the corner of Elm and Larrabee streets and take part in a few brawls and police chases. Before the weekend is over, the fate of the two friends will be irrevocably altered. Fifty years after its release, the Chicago International Film Festival will commemorate the anniversary with a free screening 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at Kennedy-King College Theater, 740 W. 63rd St. Although online RSVPs for the event are currently full, a representative at CIFF told Block Club that some standby tickets may be available that evening. If you haven’t RSVP-ed yet, he suggested getting to the venue before the doors open at 6:30 p.m. for the best chance at standby tickets. Directed by Michael Schultz and written by former Cabrini-Green resident Eric Monte, “Cooley High” is a time capsule that captures what life was once like in the now-gentrified Cabrini-Green neighborhood. The Motown-filled soundtrack — featuring “Baby Love” by the Supremes and “I Can’t Help Myself” by the Four Tops, among other hits — helps transport the viewer to the days of 1964 Chicago, when the film is set. Today, Cooley Vocational High School is a community of gated apartments. Overgrown vines and weeds now sprout where the protagonists once lived and played. “I hope that people will realize the importance that this film has for not only telling a story, but for documenting history,” said Pemon Rami, a writer and director as well as former director of educational and public programs at The DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center in Washington Park. “When you look at ‘Cooley High’ and they get on that bus and they ride through that community that is now the Apple Store and Crate & Barrel, history is documented in the visuals of those films in that era.” Rami worked with Schultz to do preliminary location research for the film and help cast its star parts, he said. “Cooley High” was responsible for jumpstarting the careers of local powerhouses like Jackie Taylor, founder of the Black Ensemble Theater in Uptown. Movies like John Singleton’s 1991 debut “Boyz N the Hood” likely wouldn’t exist without “Cooley High” to pave the way. Wednesday’s event will feature a panel discussion with Rami, Taylor, Grow Greater Englewood’s Anton Seals Jr. and WGN producer Tyra Martin immediately following the screening. “I think the film was so popular and is so popular because it shows the strong side of what it means to be Black in Chicago,” Taylor said. “The film showed the opposite of what was perpetuated [about] Cabrini-Green. The film showed the truth. We were a family. We had ups and downs like any other family, but we cared about each other. We supported each other and we helped each other.” A post shared by Michael Dembov (@chicago_history) “Cooley High” is an autobiographical story based on Monte’s life ditching school, making friends and “doing some crazy things” while growing up in the Cabrini-Green projects, he said in a 2006 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer. When people talked about crime and violence in America at the time, Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and Cabrini-Green in Chicago were always at the center, Monte said. But he had “one of the best childhoods imaginable,” with best friends and the greatest mother, he said. He wrote “Cooley High” to depict that side of life, he said. Monte quit his job as co-creator of the Black-family sitcom “Good Times”  to focus on “Cooley High” because he “knew it was going to be a hit,” he said. The film earned $13 million at the box office on a $750,000 budget. “When we were developing movies during that period of time, the purpose was to uplift the people that were watching it and to uplift our communities to make them feel better about themselves,” Rami said. “The nature of ‘Cooley High’ to me has more to do with the ability to show what friendship was like, what male relationships were like, and also what the times were like. It was the first opportunity that we had to see our people in that light.” Making “Cooley High” feel real extended beyond the page. Rami, an artist with connections across the city, cast aspiring actors from the local theater scene — many who’d never starred in a movie before, he said. When scouting locations, Rami met with members of the street gangs in Cabrini-Green to inform them about the movie, he said. Some of the cast were real members of a local gang in Chicago. “That was part of my responsibility, going in and doing locations to get people to know that we had their best interests at heart,” Rami said. Taylor was one of the film’s breakout stars. She plays Johnny Mae, one of Cochise’s love interests. Taylor, who grew up in the Cabrini-Green neighborhood, could recognize some of the characters Monte was referencing in the film, she said. The experience of acting in a film so close to home “touched my heart,” she said. “[Cabrini-Green] was simple,” Taylor said. “We were young kids, doing what young kids do, and we all had ambitions.” The film is just as important now as it was when it was released, she said. “‘[Cooley High]’ focuses on humanity,” Taylor said. “It doesn’t focus on the violence of humanity, except to say violence is ignorant and it should not be tolerated by anyone. It resonates because people can relate to it and the emotions from it are human emotions.” Like the similarly themed 1973 coming-of-age film “American Graffiti,” “Cooley High” ends with epilogue-like updates on the characters’ lives. One is inspired to go to Hollywood and become a successful screenwriter to commemorate his friends. At its core, that success is what makes “Cooley High” stand the test of time, Rami said. The movie is real in its portrayal of Black communities, but there’s still a “win” that brings us back to the film, he said. “Somebody has to win at the thing, to not only be able to tell the story, but also to be able to reflect all our future possibilities,” Rami said. “I hope that, as people look back at this film, they realize the importance of storytelling is identifying who you’re writing for, why you’re writing the story and what you want people to do once they see it.” Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/23/new-residential-tower-pitched-for-magnificent-mile/,56-Story Residential Tower Pitched For Mag Mile,"by
				Melody Mercado",19 hours ago,Downtown,NA,"DOWNTOWN — A newly proposed 56-story apartment tower would bring nearly 500 apartments to the Magnificent Mile. AMLI Residential, a luxury apartment developer, is proposing a 498-unit apartment tower at 669 N. Michigan Ave., currently home to the Niketown store, Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd) announced in his weekly newsletter. The proposed 668-foot tower would feature retail space on its first and second floors, parking on levels three through seven, amenity space on levels nine and 41 and apartments on levels 10-40 and 42-55, according to a presentation for the development. Of the 498 apartments, 337 would be “efficiency” or studio units and 161 “standard” apartments with one or more bedrooms, according to the presentation. The plans also include 199 parking spaces and a 200-space bike storage room. Fifty residences, about 10 percent of the total units, would be designated as affordable. Such developments are required by the city to set aside 20 percent of units as affordable, but Amli plans to make an in-lieu payment to the Chicago Housing Authority to satisfy its remaining affordability requirement, according to a presentation outlining the plans. Plans show the building would stand on the northeast corner of Michigan Avenue and Erie Street and extend north towards Huron Street. The parking entrance would be along Erie Street, while trash and loading zones would be on the alley behind the building, parallel to Michigan Avenue. A traffic study by Kimley-Horn & Associates, Inc., found that traffic in the area is expected to stay about the same if the proposal is approved as-is. The study found that during the busiest hours, wait times at nearby intersections are projected to rise by no more than five seconds, with lines of cars growing by about three cars. The main trouble spot could be the westbound lanes of Ontario Street at Michigan Avenue, where evening rush-hour backups may get about three cars longer and sometimes stretch into the next intersection. The problem comes from traffic lights that aren’t in sync: Michigan Avenue’s light stays green longer than nearby St. Clair Street’s, so westbound drivers on Ontario often sit through a couple of St. Clair cycles before they can cross Michigan. Reilly said in his newsletter the development would help bring more foot traffic and customers to the Magnificent Mile, which has struggled with vacancy issues post-pandemic but has recently seen a rebound with new retail tenants, including the Harry Potter Shop. “This project represents continued private investment along the Magnificent Mile and supports efforts to keep Michigan Avenue an active and attractive corridor for residents, businesses, and visitors,” Reilly wrote. The project needs approval from the Chicago Plan Commission and City Council before construction can begin. Residents can submit feedback to Reilly on the proposal here. Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/22/does-chicago-comfort-food-exist-for-vegans-yes-and-we-found-it/,Does Chicago Comfort Food Exist For Vegans? Yes — And We Found It,"by
				Linze Rice","September 22, 2025",Block Club Eats,NA,"CHICAGO — Chicago is a meat town. Tell someone you don’t like all-beef hot dogs or your Italian beef dipped in gravy and you may get an obscene hand gesture. During its Union Stockyard years, the city used “everything about the hog except the squeal,” Upton Sinclair wrote in his 1906 novel, “The Jungle.” At the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Vienna Beef was just getting its start, charging a dime for sausages covered in mustard and onions from a booth in the “Old Vienna” exhibit. The food spot became so popular, the brothers-in-law behind it decided to stay in town, building a legacy that became integral to Chicago’s identity. Yet at the same World’s Fair, the Vegetarian Federal Union also set up an exhibit as a competing movement was taking shape: going meatless. Some advocated against using animal products altogether. As Chicago in the late 1800s was turning to those very animal products to bulk up its big shoulders, it was simultaneously becoming the “epicenter for vegetarianism,” according to historians. Today, Chicago is home to Vienna Beef’s Hot Dog University as well as The Vegan Museum. PETA recently recognized our meat-lovers’ town as the epicenter of vegan-friendly cuisine. In a city that still consumes meat and cheese like air and water, Block Club wondered: Are comfort food staples like Italian beef and deep-dish pizza as readily available to vegans as they are carnivores? As it turns out, yes. Here’s where to find vegan versions of some of Chicago’s most loved and consumed foods. A post shared by Kitchen 17 – 100% Vegan Restaurant (@kitchen17chicago) Do Chicagoans eat deep-dish pizza every day? Of course not. Should they be able to if they want? Absolutely — and that includes vegans. Cue Kitchen 17, 2554 W. Diversey Ave. in West Lakeview, where you can get 12- and 16-inch deep-dish pizza, sans animal products, with toppings that include meatless pepperoni and sausage and housemade vegan cheese. Online reviewers say it’s one of the best vegan deep-dish pies in the city. Pizzas start at $24 and go up from there, depending on size and toppings. Warehouse Bar & Pizzeria, 1419 W. Fullerton Ave. in Lincoln Park, offers 10- and 14-inch vegan deep-dish pizzas filled with Selfish Cow vegan cheese. Pizzas start at $23.95, with the option to add meat-free sausage or pepperoni. For the casual pizza consumer, Warehouse also offers a vegan thin-crust option. And no Chicago pizza discourse would be complete without mention of the pizza puff. Can’t Believe It’s Not Meat, 1368 1/2 E. 53rd St. in Hyde Park, serves up a vegan version with meatless “Italian meat,” vegan cheese and spinach, with fries and mild sauce. Hot dogs are practically a way of life in Chicago. Fortunately, this rite of passage is available to all local eaters, carnivores or not. Among the options: You can also get a Chicago-style vegan dog at institutions like The Wieners Circle in Lincoln Park, Budacki’s Drive In in Ravenswood, Portillo’s and Rate Field. Need even more options? Here are 22 other veggie dogs Chicagoans love. A post shared by Can’t Believe It’s 🚫 Meat (@cantbelieveitsnotmeatinc) Hot links — spicy little sausages smothered in barbecue sauce — are a staple on the South and West sides. Get four vegan hot links — drenched in housemade sauce and served with seasoned fries and wheat bread — from Can’t Believe It’s Not Meat in Hyde Park, 1368 1/2 E. 53rd St. Every city has a signature meat sandwich. Chicago’s is the Italian beef. You can get a regular one just about anywhere in the city, but for a vegan-friendly version, go to Can’t Believe It’s Not Meat in Hyde Park, 1368 1/2 E. 53rd St. For $15.95, the Italian Not Beef serves up thinly sliced vegan beef with sweet peppers and housemade au jus on a French roll; it’s topped with mild giardiniera and served with a side of seasoned fries. Top it off with vegan cheese for 75 cents, and if you’re feeling extra Chicago, add a vegan Italian sausage for $5. Google reviewers give the sandwich a “10/10” and claim they “couldn’t believe it wasn’t meat.” You can also grab a plant-based beef at Buona, 613 N. McClurg Court in Streeterville. Buona’s Italian Beefless Sandwich ($8.99) uses Upton’s Naturals seitan made exclusively for the restaurant chain, plus vegan cheese and roasted sweet peppers. Originating in Chicago’s Puerto Rican community, the jibarito is a sandwich that swaps fried plantain patties for slices of bread and is stuffed with veggies, cheeses, sauces and meat. The Jibarito Stop, 1646 W. 18th St. in the Heart of Chicago neighborhood, had been a go-to spot for vegan jibaritos, but the restaurant remains temporarily closed after a debilitating fire earlier this year. It’s unclear when it will be able to reopen. Fortunately, Chicagoans have other options — notably, Smash Jibarito, a popular pop-up restaurant that’s had a kitchen residency at Desert Hawk, 2049 W. Division St. in West Town and recently opened its first permanent location on Humboldt Park’s Paseo Boricua. Known for its unique take on a jibarito-meets-smashburger, Smash Jibarito offers a vegan version of its Ogillo and Estilo Animal sandwiches, replacing the beef patties with an Impossible burger patty and removing the cheese and mayo. Like the meaty version, the meat substitute base is blended with the restaurant’s signature spices and flattened razor-thin on the flattop. There are two rules to Chicago sauces: no to ketchup, yes to mild sauce. At The Black Vegan in Little Village, 2300 S. Kedzie Ave., choose your own adventure with either the portabella or lion’s mane mushroom wings with fries smothered in mild sauce. Or opt for the six-piece “boneless buffalo wings” with fries from Can’t Believe It’s Not Meat in Hyde Park, 1368 1/2 E. 53rd St., and choose mild sauce for the topping.

				Madison Savedra","September 24, 2025","Uptown, Edgewater, Rogers Park",NA,"EDGEWATER — Emanuel Congregation, a synagogue in Edgewater, is planning a redevelopment of its longtime home, hoping to embrace its lakefront views — and potentially bring in a commercial or residential component. Emanuel Congregation, 5959 N. Sheridan Road, opened in Edgewater in 1955 after buying the land in 1944, according to synagogue leaders. At the time of construction, officials were considering having DuSable Lake Shore Drive continue north past its current end point of Hollywood Avenue and into the north suburbs, which would’ve partitioned the synagogue from Lake Michigan. As a result, the synagogue was designed with the assumption that there would be a highway in its backyard; the entire east side of the building is soundproofed and doesn’t have any windows — or views of Lake Michigan, said Andrew Degenholtz, a member of Emanuel Congregation’s executive committee. But only a few years after the synagogue opened, officials decided against extending the drive to the suburbs and ended the highway at Hollywood Avenue. The synagogue was also built to hold a lot more capacity than what it currently needs; at its peak, the congregation had about 1,000 households, and it currently has about 250 households, Degenholtz said. The number of households has slightly increased over the past couple of years, but the existing 35,000-square-foot building is still too large, too inefficient and too expensive to maintain, Degenholtz said. Recently, the synagogue’s leaders have been planning how they could improve its current home and ensure its future for generations to come, Degenholtz said. They decided to finally move forward with initial steps to build a new home, announcing the plans to their membership earlier this year. Renderings of what a new synagogue could look like show a building that sits closer to the lakefront with a circle driveway on the west side. It would have windows all around, including in the sanctuary, where religious services are held. Being able to bring that element of being close to nature and the lake will be a boon to the synagogue’s community, said Emanuel Congregation Cantor Shelly Friedman. Right now, the best views of the lake can be found in the synagogue’s parking lots, which abuts the building on the east side, she said. The synagogue also neighbors residential high rises along Sheridan Road, another development that was not there when the campus was built. Congregation leaders are considering adding a residential or commercial element to the campus, but there are no concrete plans for that element at this time, they said. The synagogue plans to have robust community engagement to determine what neighbors would like to see added on the site, leaders said. The priority is to build a long-lasting home for Emanuel Congregation, but if there’s a way to bring in the greater Edgewater community into their plans, they’d like to, Friedman said. “We love that we’re a Jewish community, but we’re a Jewish community at our best when we open up our doors to everybody,” she said. One hurdle the synagogue redevelopment will need to face is its zoning. The building predates Chicago’s modern zoning code and isn’t in conformity with its current zoning designation, which means it’ll need to be changed before any redevelopment could happen, synagogue leaders said. It will also need to go through additional city regulations due to its proximity to Lake Michigan, as it falls under the Lakefront Protection Ordinance. Support Local News!

				Manny Ramos","September 23, 2025","Uptown, Edgewater, Rogers Park",NA,"UPTOWN — State lawmakers said they are blocking $4 million in grant aid from being sent to the closed Weiss Hospital after its owner “ghosted” the community. The move comes a month after Manoj Prasad, owner and CEO of Weiss’ parent company, Resilience Healthcare, promised he was working with lawmakers to file an appeal with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. State Sen. Mike Simmons said he can’t get Prasad to return a phone call as the deadline to file the appeal approaches despite his and other lawmakers’ successful efforts to funnel more money into Weiss. “Dr. Prasad ghosted us,” Simmons said. “We need the CEO of this hospital and his private equity billionaire buddies to get their act together because we’ve done our part.” The lawmakers joined about two dozen community organizers Monday outside of the hospital’s closed emergency room at 4646 N. Marine Drive to call on Prasad to file an appeal and fix the litany of problems facing the hospital. The deadline to file an appeal with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services is Wednesday. But the appeal is only one step toward getting the hospital up and running again. Hospital leadership will need to address the many problems that prompted the feds to kick Weiss out of the Medicare program, which accounted for more than 65 percent of inpatient revenues in 2024, according to the most recent data collected by the state. “The sudden closure of Weiss weeks ago … was truly shocking and devastating to our community,” said Lilly Le, organizing director for the Vietnamese Association of Illinois. “Since the closure, we know hundreds of staff have lost their jobs. We know medical residents who had to terminate their leases to move outside of Chicago and some of whom have impacted visa status because of the termination.” Le said there is a strain on nearby hospitals that were forced to absorb the patients who would normally be treated at Weiss. “Amidst the federal cuts and attacks on community support systems, we are here to make it very clear: Owner Prasad closed Weiss’ doors and ceased most of its operations due to his own mismanagement and neglect,” Le said. “His lack of communication and efforts show us that he does not have the community’s interest at heart.” Prasad pushed back against the claims levied against him in a written statement in which he accused others of not appreciating his efforts to turn around the hospital. He said if it wasn’t for him buying the hospital in 2022, the previous owners would’ve shut it down long ago. “Where was everyone in December 2022, when the hospital was scheduled to permanently shut down? Why did no one come forward to help then or even later?” Prasad said in the statement. “Is the community’s expectation that I would come to your community to save a bankrupt hospital from closing and from losing hundreds of jobs and also bring a boatload of money while everyone else simply looks on or will they ever step up and help get the desperately needed funds?” Community members have worked to save the hospital for over a decade and have raised concern over Weiss’ rotating cast of private-equity-backed owners. They even rang the alarm to state regulators over Prasad’s efforts to buy the hospital. Ald. Angela Clay (46th) was one of those organizers calling on state regulators to look closer at the sale of the hospital and whether Prasad’s team could deliver on his promise to keep the hospital open. “We told you that this would happen. This is the first time that I’ve ever said, ‘We told you so’ and didn’t want to tell you something,” Clay said. “Why don’t we listen to the community? Why don’t we listen to the people who are going to be impacted?” Clay said buying Weiss was just a ploy to shut down the hospital and take over its prime real estate, which is a stone’s throw from the lakefront. “It is also a reality of what happens when you have private equity firms coming to prey on poor people,” Clay said. “How can we have an institution that swears that it is for the people and by the people, come in and close its doors on the same people it swore to protect?” Prasad did not respond to questions about whether he will file the appeal by Wednesday but said he has been in discussions with “several highly regarded law firms” and “plans to timely file the appeal.” “We have been in discussions with the state, county and city leadership and have obtained support for our efforts,” Prasad said. “One must remember, Weiss is a small safety-net hospital that has suffered many years of abuse and neglect that will need to be addressed. Safety-net grants need to be more evenly and equitably distributed so Weiss may get its fair share.” Yet, lawmakers like state Rep. Hoan Huynh said that’s not entirely true. He said he and others fought to get Weiss the “safety-net” designation with the state, which allowed the hospital to qualify for millions of dollars in grants. “We were able to bring back millions and millions of dollars to this hospital every year from Springfield,” Huynh said. “It was up to them to make sure they were able to make the proper adjustments to fix their existing problems [and] existing infrastructure violations.” Huynh said he and others aren’t confident Prasad is going to spend the money appropriately, which is why they are withholding the money until an appeal is filed. The state has responded to repeated violations happening at Weiss and has produced nearly a dozen investigative reports since January, according to records obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health. In June, Weiss’ air conditioner went out and left patients seeking care in sweltering heat. The hospital was forced to shut down its emergency department and transfer most patients to its sister hospital, West Suburban Medical Center in Oak Park. That hospital’s air conditioning also went out, leaving patients in sweltering conditions again. In July, state investigators again surveyed Weiss Hospital and found that patients in the emergency department weren’t getting proper care because of “lack of equipment and monitoring devices.” During that visit, two doctors told investigators the hospital was unsafe for patients. One doctor said the emergency department continues to “not be safe due to lack of ability to monitor and treat appropriately.” The other doctor said they had “serious concerns” about the care patients were receiving and that the emergency department wasn’t able to “safely intubate a patient.” The group that huddled outside of Weiss Monday attempted to hand deliver a petition to Prasad that called on him to keep the hospital open. When they tried to enter the hospital, the door was locked. Simmons pulled out his cellphone to call Prasad and ask him to meet with the community. He was sent to voicemail. Support Local News!

				Ariel Parrella-Aureli","September 23, 2025","Logan Square, Humboldt Park, Avondale",NA,"CHICAGO — It’s been 15 years since comic Cameron Esposito has lived in Logan Square — and yet, every time they visit the city, it feels frozen in time for them. The nationally recognized comic, actor and writer from suburban Western Springs spent their formative years in Chicago, teaching and performing while living at Troy and Diversey. They co-founded the free comedy open mic night at the dive bar Cole’s Bar, 2338 N. Milwaukee Ave., in 2009, and it has become an award-winning comedy open mic that’s drawn everyone from up-and-coming comics to well-known names. At the time, it was a new concept that gave space to comics of different backgrounds, especially women and queer people like Esposito, they said. “It kind of gave permission to some folks who wouldn’t usually be at a mic to not just be on the list, but also come perform,” Esposito said during a recent interview with Block Club while visiting family in Lincoln Park. “When there’s different perspectives on a lineup, it makes everything better.” Esposito, 43, now lives in Los Angeles, but their Chicago memories have influenced how they perform and see the world, they said. Next month, they’re returning to Chicago for their Steppenwolf debut with “FEAT,” a comedic solo show based on a near-death experience last year that forced them to take a closer look at parental relationships, childhood and parenting styles — which they’ll perform while being “very pregnant,” Esposito said. Although Esposito didn’t time the show with their pregnancy, the symbolism of performing with a large belly while discussing parents and childhood may be the universe’s own doing, they said. “You don’t know how the timing is going to work, but the universe is like, ‘I gotchu,'” Esposito said. “I can’t believe how much the universe wanted me to do this at Steppenwolf.” When it was time to find a venue, Steppenwolf was the first that came to mind, and they knew the debut had to be in Chicago. Coming back to perform a painfully honest and impactful show like “FEAT” at a renowned theatrical institution is a dream come true for Esposito. “FEAT” is about a foot surgery infection that turned into a full-body illness that almost killed Esposito. During the traumatic time, they wore diapers and were taken care of by their mother, who flew out to Los Angeles to live with them. “I was so sick, I was literally in diapers,” they said. “I don’t think many people in their 40s get to see what their mom would be like when they were like a teeny kid, and especially leading into having a child, it was like an incredible mindf— — when you are in diapers, you can see how somebody might parent.” That pivotal time led to the show’s creation, complete with a pun for a title, which was an easy task since Esposito has always used real-life experiences to create their one-person comedy shows that use humor and have a story arc. “It just feels like it was unavoidable for me, and that kind of the work I’ve always done, and that started here in Chicago,” they said. Esposito hopes the show will attract a diverse audience ranging from parents to teens who are beginning to understand adulthood and see how parenting styles change over time, they said. Esposito doesn’t miss a beat when they talk about how the city and its open mics shaped them as a comic. Because there isn’t as much of an official comic industry and all eyes aren’t on Chicago, artists have time to develop and “eat s—, which everybody does at the start” before refining their skills and finding their space, Esposito said. “Because people do different jobs here, it’s like a real audience, and L.A. doesn’t really have that,” they said. Since leaving Chicago, Esposito has released four comedy specials and albums; has appeared on Netflix, Max, ABC, NBC and Hulu; hosted two long-running, popular podcasts — “Put Your Hands Together” and “Queery” — and released a best-selling memoir, “Save Yourself.” And yet, one of their proudest moments in life and as a comic is creating the open mic night at Cole’s Bar, they said. “I grew up in a community where everybody knows each other, even in the city, so I think that was always my goal, to create community,” Esposito said. “That lasting legacy — again, it’s so cheesy. Not every standup comic is like, ‘I hope I can create community in my wake everywhere I go,’ but it’s just my personality. I can’t escape my personality.” FEAT runs Oct. 3-4 at Steppenwolf.

				Molly DeVore",9 hours ago,"Jefferson Park, Portage Park, Norwood Park",NA,"PORTAGE PARK — Portage Park’s new mayor might not be able to sniff out political corruption, but she certainly has a nose for squirrels. Eden, a Great Pyrenees-Labrador mix, won Portage Park’s first-ever pet election Sunday, rising to the top in a field of more than 60 candidates. Katherine Cartwright, Eden’s owner and communications director, said the 5-year-old pup already has a visible presence in Portage Park, as she visits the neighborhood’s namesake park everyday, rain or shine. Eden, whom Cartwright rescued from PAWS, wants to use her newfound platform to promote animal rescues across the city, Cartwright said. Cartwright donates all the proceeds from her Etsy shop, which sells vintage goods, to PAWS, One Tail At A Time and other charities. Eden also wants to “keep up the positivity in the park,” Cartwright said. “She loves smelling every stroller, she loves kids so she just wants to continue to go around the park every day and spread joy,” she said. Eden will be joined in office by her “first gentle-dog,” Bronco, whom she met in Portage Park when she was just a puppy, said Jill Sorn, Bronco’s owner. The Friends of Portage Park Advisory Council announced the pet election in July. Sophie McNeill, the advisory council’s market manager, said the goal was to celebrate the neighborhood’s many furry friends. “Portage Park is very, very pet-friendly,” McNeill told Block Club in July. “There are always lots of dogs at the [farmers] market, and we also get cats in backpacks and birds in backpacks and even the occasional reptile, so we wanted to do something to honor all the animals in the neighborhood.” Eden’s term will last for one year. The crowded field was narrowed down to four candidates through online votes ahead of the Sunday election, which was held during the Portage Park Farmers Market. Market attendees could vote in the contest by donating one non-perishable food item, which was given to the Irving Park Food Pantry. The Portage Park Advisory Council was able to collect almost 1,200 donations, including some pet food. “This was such a great turnout and they raised so much for the food pantry. I just think we should do more positive things like this,” Cartwright said. “That’s what dogs do, they bring positivity.” Eden was too busy wagging her tail and licking babies on Sunday to comment on her new political office, but she can be found on Instagram here.

				Ariel Parrella-Aureli","September 23, 2025","Logan Square, Humboldt Park, Avondale",NA,"LOGAN SQUARE — A ramen restaurant and two neighboring bars at Milwaukee and Fullerton avenues in Logan Square are closing — but new businesses are coming in. Furious Spoon and the Pink Squirrel bar quietly closed this month, and Deadbolt will close, though its final day has not yet been decided. All three were under the same ownership. The owners did not announce the closures except for a small handwritten note on the doors of Furious Spoon, 2410 N. Milwaukee Ave. “After 16 years of serving Logan Square, it is time for Furious Spoon to say goodbye. Thank you for sharing noods with us,” reads the note. The restaurant was the last Furious Spoon location. At one point, there were seven Furious Spoons in the city and one in Evanston; the Lincoln Park location was the most recent one to close in 2023. The Logan Square Furious Spoon and Pink Squirrel are listed as permanently closed on Google Maps, while Deadbolt still appears open and has a private event scheduled for Friday. But Esam Hani, a popular restaurateur who owns several businesses along Milwaukee Avenue under his company, One of a Kind Hospitality, confirmed he’s taking over the three attached storefronts and is planning new concepts there. Company officials for Furious Spoon, Pink Squirrel and Deadbolt did not reply to a request for comment. Hani said negotiations to take  over the businesses had been in the works for about six months. Hani filed business license applications this month for the spaces at 2412-2414 N. Milwaukee Ave., one for a restaurant in the former Furious Spoon corner space and one for the Pink Squirrel and Deadbolt spaces, which would be combined for a new bar, according to Ald. Daniel La Spata’s 1st Ward office. La Spata announced the license application in his newsletter last week and is working with the city and owner to get more details. Notices for the applications were posted on the business doors Monday, and Hani said he’s working with his team on two new concepts, though it’s too soon to share more details. Deadbolt’s exit from the neighborhood is welcomed by some neighbors, who petitioned for the late-night bar to close after an April shooting outside, neighbors and La Spata previously said. Deadbolt has been in Logan Square since 2016, when owners took over longtime dive bar Two Way Lounge. Neighbors, business owners and employees who work and live near the bar previously told Block Club the shooting was part of a disturbing pattern by Deadbolt’s clientele, who they say brought violence and unsafe conditions to the block — with little intervention from the bar’s owners. “There’s no better person than me to clean it up,” Hani said Monday. Hani, one of the business owners who was displeased with Deadbolt’s operations along the block, owns La Victoria nearby at 2447 N. Milwaukee Ave., as well as Cafe con Leche, the Harding Tavern, Saba, Mr. E’s, Red Star Liquor & Deli and The Walk In, which recently temporarily closed for a remodel. Support Local News!

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/24/significant-changes-to-obama-center-housing-protection-ordinance-to-be-introduced-wednesday/,Obama Center Housing Ordinance Set For Final City Council Vote,"by
				Maxwell Evans",13 hours ago,"Hyde Park, Woodlawn, South Shore",NA,"SOUTH SHORE — A drastically modified slate of South Side housing protections passed City Council’s housing committee the same day it was introduced after the initial proposal  stalled in the committee for nearly two years. The South Shore Housing Preservation Ordinance — a sweeping proposal to fund homeownership programs and reserve city-owned land for income-based housing — was introduced by Ald. Desmon Yancy (5th) in October 2023. The ordinance had been stuck in the council’s housing committee since its introduction, while fellow South Shore Alds. Greg Mitchell (7th) and Michelle Harris (8th) did not publicly support its passage. Yancy, along with Alds. William Hall (6th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), introduced a substitute Jackson Park Housing Pilot Ordinance during Wednesday’s housing committee meeting. Backers made “significant” changes to the original proposal, Yancy said. The new proposal reflects its predecessor’s broad goals around increasing affordable housing stock and accessibility near the future Obama Presidential Center, though many details were changed. Committee members passed the substitute ordinance Wednesday. The proposal could receive a final council vote as soon as Thursday. The Jackson Park ordinance proposal would reserve vacant, city-owned lots at 63rd Street and Blackstone Avenue, 69th Street and Stony Island Avenue, 67th Street and Dorchester Avenue, 71st Street and Paxton Avenue and 1708 E. 71st St. for affordable apartments. At least 75 percent of the units in these developments would be affordable to residents making up to 60 percent of the area median income, or $71,940 for a four-person household. The ordinance would also: The proposed ordinance now focuses on a “pilot area” bounded by 60th Street, King Drive, South Chicago Avenue, 71st Street and DuSable Lake Shore Drive — which includes nearly all of Woodlawn and parts of South Shore and Greater Grand Crossing. The original proposal would have covered all of South Shore. “We’ve worked really, really hard to bring the other South Shore alders on board, and were unfortunately just not able to get there,” though provisions like the tax relief program would still benefit the whole neighborhood, Yancy told Block Club Tuesday. Mitchell — whom Yancy accused of assaulting him during an argument over the proposal last year — and Harris did not respond to requests for comment. After the original proposal stagnated for more than a year, efforts to retool it picked up this summer with support from Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office, Yancy said. “I don’t think we would’ve gotten here without the support of the mayor’s office,” he said. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. The ordinance’s passage would be “a win for the Jackson Park community,” Yancy said. “It sets a floor that we can build on as we look at increasing the area that could be supported by this sort of work.” The new proposal would create an Office of the Tenant Advocate that would educate tenants about their rights, as well as city housing policies and laws. The office could also contract with other agencies to offer services like emergency relocation assistance. The ordinance would also provide legal services to renters facing eviction who make less than 80 percent of the area median income, and it would give tenant associations in the pilot area a chance to buy their properties before they land on the open market. Some aspects of the original South Shore proposal — like caps on rental application fees and security deposits, bans on move-in fees and neighborhood-specific modifications to the 2021 affordable requirements ordinance — were cut from the updated version. The Jackson Park proposal is “more cognizant of the current budget of the city of Chicago, which is why [it’s] mostly budget-neutral,” Yancy said. The modified proposal also reflects concerns over the Trump administration’s push to slash federal housing funds and dismantle equitable housing programs, he said. “We made sure [the ordinance] couldn’t be explicitly tied to race, even though it’s on the South and West sides,” Yancy said. “It had to be something that would stand up to challenges in court, and I believe this meets a pretty high bar.” The latest proposal would be another “huge” step toward limiting displacement near the Obama Center if it passes, said Dixon Romeo, executive director of Southside Together and a member of the Obama CBA Coalition. The coalition helped draft and rally support for the initial and modified proposals. Though the bulk of the latest proposal doesn’t reach south of 71st Street, South Shore residents have made clear their desire to “cover the whole neighborhood” with housing protections, and work to secure legislation in the neighborhood, will continue, Romeo said. “What this ordinance does is it shows that we can build on the work that we were doing before,” Romeo said. “We built off the Woodlawn ordinance to get here, and we can build off this one to get our final version. “Any time you can say there’s gonna be, at minimum, thousands of people who — not tomorrow, but soon — are going to get more housing … there’s no way I could look at that and say this [latest proposal] is a compromise or a sacrifice. We’re moving the ball forward.” Voters in four South Shore precincts overwhelmingly supported protections like those outlined in the ordinance in a non-binding ballot question in November. Similar questions about housing protections were on some South Side voters’ ballots in 2019 and in 2023, garnering support from nearly 90 percent of voters in each election. Some South Shore residents and real estate professionals spoke out against the new proposal during Wednesday’s meeting, saying they only learned of the legislation days ago and calling on alderpeople to hold off on a vote so it could be modified. “The fact that we were only given updates on this ordinance yesterday … means that there’s something woefully wrong with the way the system is working,” said Sharon Lewis, a South Shore resident and founder of the Meadows Eastside Community Resource Organization.” The proposal’s use of vacant land along 71st Street and Stony Island clashes with plans in progress for the commercial corridors’ development, said LaShawn Brown, program manager for Special Service Area No. 42. The agency and the South Shore Chamber are developing the CorridorLive plan, which lays out a framework for resident-led and -owned business developments along 71st Street. “South Shore has so much to gain and so much to lose,” Brown said. “This ordinance, without … allowing community members to see it and discuss it and amend it, risks undermining the catalytic investments already underway. “A balanced approach — protecting affordability on side streets while fostering mixed-income, market driven growth on corridors — is the only way to ensure 71st Street and Stony Island becomes the thriving community asset it was always meant to be.” Some opponents to the Jackson Park ordinance said at Wednesday’s meeting they were not against affordable housing and supported some form of a community benefits ordinance, which Yancy pledged to support during his 2023 aldermanic campaign. However, South Shore homeowners have often opposed affordable apartments and policies which prioritize low-income residents, citing the existing concentration of renters with housing choice vouchers in the neighborhood after public housing was eradicated elsewhere. A 2017 Roosevelt University study found South Shore was home to 3,528 renters with vouchers. At the time, that was more than the combined population of voucher holders in 30 other community areas, including nearby Hyde Park and East Side. Advocates have called for an increase in affordable housing in all neighborhoods, amid local and national housing crises. Homelessness in Chicago increased by 207 percent from 2023 to 2024, and by 116 percent in Illinois, according to the Illinois Office to Prevent and End Homelessness. That was driven in part by “drastically” increased housing costs, assistant director Colleen Mahoney said earlier this year. Support Local News!

				Jamie Nesbitt Golden","September 19, 2025","Bronzeville, Near South Side",NA,"BRONZEVILLE — Community leaders are showing their support for Bronzeville’s Sip & Savor by sponsoring a free coffee drive there Saturday after thieves broke into the cafe. Entrepreneurs Early Walker and George Daniels and alds. Pat Dowell (3rd) and Stephanie Coleman (16th) are joining with Sip & Savor owner Trez Pugh III for the offer. Free coffee will be available for the first 300 customers 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Saturday at the cafe, 78 E. 47th St. Walker said he was moved to act after learning of the burglaries: A trio of thieves broke into the cafe after hours — twice in one week this month — and stole high-end bourbon, vodka, cakes and muffins, according to cafe staff. Pugh said he incurred $2,000 in damages. Police said no one was in custody, and the investigation is ongoing. “I want this to be a movement. There’s no reason why he should not be the next Black Starbucks of our community,” said Walker, who is sponsoring the first 100 coffees for Sip & Savor customers. “We need to support him and let him know we’re standing behind him.” Dowell and Coleman announced they, too, would sponsor 100 coffees each to help the cause. Coleman noted Pugh’s Englewood ties while commending him on his commitment to staying in the community, adding that an Englewood location of Sip & Savor is on her wishlist. “This is a workforce investment. So we’re so grateful for you and your stick-to-it-iveness,” Coleman said. “The hospitality industry has not been so kind, especially to the Black business owners. Let’s keep Black businesses and Black people in our city.” Pugh said he’s been overwhelmed by the love he’s received from neighbors and local businesses. The entrepreneur was one of the first retail tenants to set up shop at the revamped Rosenwald Apartments when they reopened in 2019. Now, Pugh owns seven locations across the city — including the South Loop store that took over the former Starbucks storefront on Roosevelt Road in 2023. According to a KeyBank survey of small business owners across the country, 50 percent are worried about inflation and rising costs, with 46 percent feeling that their performance has fallen short of 2025 projections and 72 percent bracing themselves for the impact the current tariff wars could have on their bottom lines. Pugh said he’s been able to weather the challenges by being “innovative and creative.” In the past, he’s hosted vendor pop-ups at his cafe and partnered with Black-owned enterprises like Turner Haus Brewery, which opened a taproom inside the Bronzeville cafe in 2023. Walker is hopeful people who take them up on the free coffee Saturday will be inspired to pay the generosity forward as Sip & Savor customers. “Get your pastry. Get your doughnut,” Walker said. “The whole purpose of doing this is to continue to bring money into the community.” Support Local News!

				Maxwell Evans","September 19, 2025","Roseland, Pullman",NA,"ROSELAND — A South Side candle company is celebrating the opening of its shop this weekend in Roseland, which will also be used to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses. Max Candle Co. opened its storefront at 11336 S. Michigan Ave. last week after more than five years of doing pop-ups at local markets and hosting candlemaking classes. Patrons can shop the candlemaker’s products — like candles, wax melts and scented oils — as well as items from nine small businesses that make hair products, essential oils, clothing and jewelry. A “makerspace” at the shop offers a membership program where budding entrepreneurs can get 20 hours of access every month to screenprinting equipment, office amenities, coworking space, a podcasting and content creation room and business consultations. Max Candle Co. will celebrate the shop’s launch noon Saturday, and there will be a ribbon-cutting at 12:30 p.m. To register for the free event, click here. “The purpose of the makerspace is to help those business owners who don’t have the financial resources to get their own retail store or buy shelf space from [major] retailers,” CEO Markell Sylvain said. “We’ve got some roots there and just want to see [Roseland] thrive like it used to.” President and co-founder Pauline Sylvain-Lewis, who is Sylvain’s mother, started making candles following the death of her brother, Sylvain said. “She found that the art of making candles was very healing” as a way to process her grief, and once Sylvain finished college, he worked with her to turn her practice into a family business, he said. Max Candle Co. began by offering candlemaking classes in addition to selling candles and other aromatherapy essentials, and it formed a company during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sylvain said. The business went through several retail incubators as well as grant and entrepreneurship programs to be “storefront ready,” including three years in a marketplace incubator through the Far South Community Development Corporation, which is a co-sponsor of the grand opening ceremony. The Michigan Avenue storefront is intended as an experiment in running a market and co-working space, Sylvain said. The company owns a vacant lot at 1224 W. 111th St. on which Sylvain and his mother plan to build and operate a multipurpose retail building. The Michigan Avenue location, where Max Candle Co. will be for at least the next year or two, “is a smaller-scale [version] of what we plan to do” out of the 111th Street development, Sylvain said. “With that development … we’ll have more square footage, more space to work with, and I think we’ll be expanding in terms of the network of business owners we plan to help grow and scale,” he said. In addition to the new store, Max Candle Co. will hold pop-up sales 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Friday and Sept. 26 at the Evergreen Park Macy’s, 9700 S. Western Ave. The candlemaker also has a booth for the last Olive-Harvey College farmers market of the season, which is 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Oct. 2 at 10001 S. Woodlawn Ave. Max Candle Co. is open 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Wednesday-Sunday. Support Local News! Subscribe to Block Club Chicago, an independent, 501(c)(3), journalist-run newsroom.

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/19/chathams-trilogy-wellness-center-opens-with-mental-health-support-life-saving-services/,"Chatham’s Trilogy Wellness Center Opens With Mental Health Support, ‘Life-Saving Services’","by
				Atavia Reed","September 19, 2025","Englewood, Chatham, Auburn Gresham",NA,"CHATHAM — A wellness center specializing in mental health support and servicing the city’s most vulnerable communities is open and accepting new clients on the South Side. With the snip of a bright orange ribbon, Trilogy Wellness Center, 8541 S. State St., opened Thursday. The facility will provide crisis services for people with emergent needs, therapy, job placement assistance and outreach services to meet neighbors where they are and direct them to the resources they might need, leaders said. The grand celebration comes nearly two years after Trilogy, a nonprofit community behavioral healthcare organization, announced it would repurpose the former Mercy Medical building in Chatham into a wellness support center. Construction on the 24,000-square-foot center was completed in phases, allowing the Trilogy team to offer peer-run drop-in services at the State Street building as early as 2023. Ald. William Hall (6th), whose ward includes the wellness center, opened his ward office in the same building in 2024. Access to mental health care has often been “overlooked and underrepresented” in communities like Chatham, said Trilogy CEO Susan Doig. Trilogy has provided services on the South Side for 15 years, but with the completion of the wellness center, the nonprofit is promising a “permanent investment” and commitment to the South Side for years to come, Doig said. “We’re not only here to celebrate a grand opening but to reaffirm our commitment to a healthier tomorrow, one in which all people have access to behavioral health services no matter what ZIP code you live in,” Doig said. Neighbors can visit the Chatham wellness center to access family, individual, adolescent and group therapy and connect with medical services. The drop-in center will provide a space to grab a meal, take a shower and connect with specialists, Doig said. September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month and Recovery Month — two topics that are essential to the work Trilogy does every day, Doig said. “We are providing life-saving services,” Doig said. Keith Fields joined Trilogy as a client in 2019, he said. At the time, he had recently been released from prison after serving a 30-year sentence that began when he was 17. When Fields started working with the nonprofit, he was “problematic” and “aggressive,” he said. But staff worked with him, listened to him and helped him find a way to express himself without anger, Fields said. One day, a peer supporter told Fields that, “You can do whatever you choose to do, but remember, you have choices,” Fields said. It changed his life. “Once I realized that I have a choice to get out of my way, to learn to work on myself and to learn the coping skills to learn what PTSD and mental illness is, that was the breakthrough,” Fields said. “They’ve given me the avenue for me to be me and to not feel ashamed that I do have these current events going on in my life.” Trilogy’s staff came to meet Fields “rain, sleet or snow,” he said. Six years later, Fields is now doing the same for others as a peer specialist on the client advisory council at Trilogy. He rides his bike from the West Side to the Chatham building each day to meet with people and spread love, he said. “I’m very honored to be here in a mentally healthy state of mind,” Fields said. “That doesn’t mean that I’m healed. That means that I’m still working, and I’ll be working for the rest of my life on me to make sure that I can show everybody else that there’s no such thing as ‘You can’t.’ “If you’re willing to fight, and even if you can’t, Trilogy is going to stand by you. Eventually, you’re going to find that there’s a lot of love in you. I’m just so honored to be a part of it.” Support Local News!

				Michael Liptrot","September 22, 2025","Austin, Garfield Park, North Lawndale",NA,"NORTH LAWNDALE — Chicago’s leading punk festival wrapped its 20th edition Sunday with Green Day bringing out thousands of fans; a lineup packed with Chicago-area bands, including The Effigies, Smoking Popes, Screeching Weasels, Pegboy, Dehd and Footballhead; and a surprise appearance by Mayor Brandon Johnson. The day concluded a triumphant 20th-anniversary celebration for Riot Fest, which featured not only a multitude of music but several stylized experiences like an Oktoberfest-inspired beer tent by Goose Island Beer Co., a karaoke bar and an arcade. The larger-than-life butter statue of “Full House” star John Stamos returned, along with the Riot Fest wedding chapel. To honor the anniversary, the fest also debuted the Riot Fest Historical Society museum, housed in a building modeled after Logan Square’s Fireside Bowl. Standouts over the weekend included “Weird Al” Yankovic playing to a ginormous crowd, a jubilant set by British band James that resulted in an on-stage dance party for their biggest hit “Laid,” the gleeful fake-blood-soaked performance rock of GWAR — and Stamos finally making his Riot Fest debut, performing with the Beach Boys. On Sunday, The Effigies and Footballhead showcased different generations of Chicago alt-rock. The Effigies, a punk band prominent in the ’80s, performed their debut album, “For Ever Grounded,” which turned 40 last year. Two stages over, alternative rock group Footballhead made their Riot Fest debut, thanking their hometown for the opportunity. “It would be nothing without the support of our community,” said singer Ryan Nolen. “We’ve been playing in Chicago DIY bands for 10 years, and this opportunity is never guaranteed, so to get to play this today is incredible.” “We love Chicago. … This festival has always been so fun to attend, and playing it too is a world-class experience,” Nolen said. The band expects to release more music this winter and spring, they told Block Club. About 2 p.m., two local ’90s bands celebrated their biggest albums. Northwest suburban pop punk band Smoking Popes celebrated the 30-year anniversary of their sophomore album, “Born To Quit,” featuring their biggest hit, “Need You Around,” and punk band Pegboy played a full album performance of their debut “Strong Reaction,” garnering a strong reaction from the crowd. The set quickly progressed to crowd surfing, with lead singer Larry Damore entering the crowd. Midway through the day, the mayor made a surprise address to the media, proclaiming Sunday as Riot Fest Day. Riot Fest is “a part of the legacy in the history of Chicago. The way you bring people together from all different backgrounds, this is who we are as a city,” Johnson told Riot Fest founder Mike Petryshyn during the public proclamation. “Mike, you are Chicago.” “For the first time, I feel like I’m accepted in Chicago,” Petryshyn said tearfully. Johnson made the announcement inside the Riot Fest Historical Society on the festival grounds, a facsimile of Fireside Bowl, a prominent punk music venue in the ’90s and 2000s. Johnson toured the building with Petryshyn, looking at memorabilia and merchandise from past festivals and photos honoring the festival’s investments in the North Lawndale community. Later in the day, other local groups, including Screeching Weasel and Dehd, took to the stage. Screeching Weasel, a Prospect Heights-based band, performed their 1991 album, “My Brain Hurts,” as the crowd steadily grew ahead of headliner Green Day. Green Day took the stage about 8:15 p.m. following sets by Jawbreaker and Idles, the latter bringing out Jack White for a second night in a row following his Saturday performance. Green Day’s set delivered their classic hits alongside commentary referencing the increased immigration enforcement activity and protests in Chicago. “Do you want fascism in America? Do you want tanks rolling down the streets of Chicago? Because we’re not going to take this,” lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong said to the crowd. Armstrong launched expletives and additional lyrics directed at the Federal Communications Commission after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel last week under pressure from the agency. Thousands of attendees packed the festival ground to watch Green Day’s set, complete with a stage modeled after the art on their seventh album, “American Idiot,” and fireworks throughout. Afterward, the exhausted crowd filed through the gates as Riot Fest wrapped for its 20th year. More photos from Riot Fest 2025 day three: Support Local News!

				Francia Garcia Hernandez","September 22, 2025","Pilsen, Little Village, Back of the Yards",NA,"PILSEN — Local officials and nonprofit leaders broke ground Friday on Casa Yucatán, a development bringing nearly 100 affordable apartments to Pilsen. The Resurrection Project, a social services and housing nonprofit, is turning a lot at 1609 W. 21st Place into an eight-story building with 98 affordable apartments. Construction is expected to be completed by fall 2026. The development will have 38 one-bedroom, 34 two-bedroom and 26 three-bedroom apartments. Amenities will include a multi-purpose room, training center, reading room, a courtyard with a playground and a green rooftop, according to The Resurrection Project’s plans. There will be on-site parking for 20 cars and indoor storage for 98 bicycles, which is more than what’s required by the city given that the building qualifies for less on-site parking due to being less than a mile from the 18th Street Pink Line station, project leaders previously said. “As we continue to confront a housing crisis across our city and issues of gentrification right here in Pilsen, I’m proud to take this step today towards building more affordable housing and ensuring that working families can stay right here,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said at Friday’s groundbreaking. All units at Casa Yucatán will be affordable for families earning 30-70 percent of the area median income, with rents ranging from $551-$1,768 per month, Resurrection Project leaders said. The project will provide housing to families who are at risk of homelessness, depend on a fixed income or are on disability, said Resurrection Project CEO Raul I. Raymundo. Casa Yucatán will be funded through a combination of private and public funds, with support from the Illinois Department of Affordable Housing and $15.8 million in city funds. The development will allow working families to stay in Pilsen, where rental costs increased by 40 percent between 2015 and 2023, said Grace Hou, Illinois Deputy Governor for Health and Human Services. It is the first housing project to receive funds from the city’s $1.25 billion housing and economic development bond, Johnson said. City Council approved the project in 2023. Officials have touted it as a “truly affordable” development that will bring back residents who have been priced out of the neighborhood. Block Club’s Madison Savedra contributed reporting.

				Leen Yassine","September 21, 2025",Arts & Culture,NA,"DOUGLASS PARK — It was all about John Stamos on day two of Riot Fest Saturday, as the “Full House” star made his triumphant debut at the festival after years of online ribbing from its organizers. Festival organizers had acquiesced to a list of Stamos’ nine demands before he would appear at the fest this year, including: organizer “Riot Mike” Petryshyn getting a tattoo in his honor, the creation of a Chicago Greek-style pizza and a John Stamos lookalike contest, which drew hoards of fans on Saturday afternoon around the famed Stamos butter statue. Among 15 competitors, Wicker Park resident Chris Maimonis was crowned the winner. He told Block Club it felt “like a dream come true.” “People have been telling me I look like Stamos since I was a little kid, and then as soon as they made this contest, everybody I know started texting me, telling me I gotta get in it,” he said. “I literally bought the ticket today just because of this.” While Maimonis had never been to Riot Fest before, he was looking forward to the rest of the day, especially seeing Jack White’s set. “It’s gonna be fun walking around today, I’ll tell you that,” he said. “I’m just on top of the world right now.” Based on cheers, the seeming runner-up was Lincoln Park resident Griffin Snead. “I’m gonna call myself that, that’s for sure,” Snead said of being runner-up. Donning a black jeans, a green button up shirt and oversized leather jacket, Snead said he dressed the part, channeling the style of Uncle Jesse, Stamos’ “Full House” character. He found out about the contest through X, formerly Twitter, and radio announcements, he said. Though Snead’s been to Riot Fest three times so far, he showed up Saturday specifically for the contest. “It was a blast. It was a great way to meet a bunch of people with incredible hair,” he said. “That’s what its really all about, is celebrating incredible hair and Greek heritage.” And finally, after a 12-year pursuit involving online harassment, Stamos himself appeared at the alternative rock fest. At 6:20 p.m. Saturday, despite light rainfall and storm threats, Stamos took to the Riot Stage alongside The Beach Boys. He stepped out playing guitar and donning an on-brand black leather jacket and shades. “How about it, after all these years, John Stamos is here?” singer Mike Love asked the crowd. Stamos first played with The Beach Boys about 40 years ago, and one of his first big shows was a 4th of July concert at the Washington Monument in 1985, according to the Ravinia Backstage Blog. The actor has famously a fan of the band and has wanted to share their music with younger generations. Stamos said the first song he sang with the band was “Barbara Ann,” per the blog — which they played Saturday night. Other favorites performed by The Beach Boys included “Forever,” which was featured in “Full House.” Clips of the classic sitcom played in the background as they performed. Eventually, Stamos took off his leather jacket to reveal a special Riot Fest T-shirt, and also swapped out his guitar for the drums. He praised the fest for “ribbing me all these years.” “You’ve kept me humble,” he said. GWAR, known for their intense constumaery and over-the-top theatrics, also attracted a ginormous crowd Saturday afternoon on the Rebel Stage, splattering them with fake blood, which could be spied on attendees long after their set. The band decapitated a character who looked a lot like Elon Musk — complete in a DOGE shirt — and destroyed a facsimile of President Donald Trump as the crowd roared its approval. Local acts were also among Saturday’s highlights. Feral Tact — a two-piece featuring Mikey Ramsay on vocals and teenager Max McQuaid on drums, born from a chance meeting tied to Chicago punk veterans Sludgeworth — rocked the Rebel Stage at 12:40 p.m., drawing a sizable crowd despite an early set time and rain. Playing Riot Fest is a fantasy come true after watching it from the wings in 2023, they told Block Club. The audience was filled with new and old fans alike, including Alyssa Duff and Kaitlyn Hackett, cousins of the lead singer. “They were playing just little small shows with family, and then different bars around Chicago [like] Cobra Lounge,” said Duff, who lives in Humboldt Park. “Then we found out they were playing here, so of course we had to get tickets and come support. And it was really good.” Seeing their growth is “crazy,” Hackett said. “It was amazing, and the mosh pit really set the vibe for the whole thing,” said Hackett, who lives in Logan Square. “We didn’t know any of the people who started that mosh pit so it wasn’t family, but they all seemed to really be enjoying it. It was really fun, and they had a good turnout.” Knuckle Puck, a five-piece rock band that formed in the suburbs in 2010, were on the Rise Stage at 5:20 p.m. They played a 60-minute set to a big crowd and celebrated 10 years since the release of their album, “Copacetic.” At 7:25 p.m., flocks of festgoers gathered at the Roots Stage for Jack White, guitarist and lead singer of defunct rock duo the White Stripes. He played hits like “Seven Nation Army,” “Icky Thump” and “Steady, As She Goes” while shredding on the guitar and drums. Headlining band Weezer closed out the night shortly after on the Riot Stage, playing a 90-minute, solar exploration-themed set. Band members donned astronaut outfits and referred to their albums as planets while celestial graphics set the backdrop. Ahead of playing their full-length debut album, “The Blue Album,” which marked its 30th anniversary last year, they featured hits like “Island in the Sun,” “Hash Pipe” and fan-favorite “Pork and Beans.” While performing “Beverly Hills,” they swapped out the lyrics to say, “Chicago, Illinois, that’s where I want to be” — which was met with cheers of approval from the crowd.

				Gwen Ihnat","September 20, 2025",Arts & Culture,NA,"DOUGLASS PARK — For most people, going to Riot Fest every September is an adventure all by itself. But for its 20th anniversary this year, Riot took things a step further, offering several destinations within the fest in a “Choose Your Own Adventure”-type format. Attendees flocked to Friday’s Riot Fest kickoff, usually the calmest day, and what turned out to be the only mudless one this year as rain hit the area late Friday. Some Riot Fest attendees who had purchased tickets from Costco didn’t realize that they had only purchased vouchers that needed to be redeemed hours before the fest to have the digital tickets show up on their phones. The confusion led to some fans approaching the Riot Fest box office for help, but tickets were eventually delivered within 45 minutes. Those who are heading to the fest with Costco tickets Saturday or Sunday should redeem them before heading out so they arrive in time. Once inside, attendees filed past the familiar carnival rides and games right after the entrance. But as they ventured deeper into Douglass Park, alternative experiences awaited. Like “Riotoberfest,” a spot-on recreation of a German Fest-themed bar, complete with Riot Fest Ale and sausage sandwiches. Next to “Riotoberfest” is a recreation of a karaoke bar for brave wannabe vocalists. As with previous years, Riot also offered a “Clerks”-themed convenience store offering ice cream, water, sunglasses and toiletries from deodorant to condoms, as well as a wedding chapel. Riotland also featured a recreation of the Logan Arcade and a Fireside Bowl recreation featuring the “Riot Fest Historical Society” with posters and merch highlights from the past 20 years. Naturally, that all revolved around the famous John Stamos butter statue, as fans anxiously await his possible appearance Saturday drumming with the Beach Boys. But those fun experiences aside, the crowd was there to see the music, with the typical diverse Riot Fest lineup featuring bands from around the world (as well as locals) in as many genres as you can imagine. In anticipation of “Weird Al” Yankovic’s closing set, the Rise stage was renamed for him for the day as “Weird Al” Yankovic’s Weird World Stage. That stage kicked off at noon with Japanese pop-punk trio Shonen Knife. The Rebel Stage soon followed up with locals The Tossers, offering an inspired mix of Irish jig and punk ethos. Back in the land of Weird, Puddles Pity Party drew an extremely large crowd anxious to see a Pagliacci-like whiteface clown singing covers of popular music (and it must be said that Puddles’ alter-ego Mike Geier has some pipes.) After a few standards like “I’m Always Chasing Rainbows,” Puddles brought out a disturbing Ronald McDonald-like fellow clown from the band Mac Sabbath to play guitar on skewed covers of Ozzy Osbourne’s “Crazy Train” and Celen Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On,” dosed with a little Metallica. Locals Harm’s Way brought the Riot Fest mosh pit back in earnest as enthusiastic fans thrashed to the band’s particularly fierce brand of hardcore (ear plugs strongly recommended). For a little less fierce and a lot more tech, iconic outfit Sparks played to a riveted crowd led by singer Russell Mael’s strong-as-ever animated vocals and his brother Ron Mael’s keyboards, in front of a full backing band. Russell Mael kicked off the set by asking the crowd “So May We Start,” referring to the band’s song of the same name, and the crowd roared in agreement. Sparks then unfurled other hits like “This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us” and “The Number One Song in Heaven.” Over on the Rebel Stage, Mattoon’s own Didjits returned for their first show in 20 years. Lead singer Rick Sims is the only member left from the original lineup, but the master frontman did his typical wowing of the crowd, offering cryptic one-line intros to songs like “(Mama Had a) Skull Baby” and “Under the Christmas Fish.” Sims also did his typical mocking of the crowd, making fun of the fact that the punk band was playing a “festival.” As the day stretched into evening, Brooklyn-based indie rockers The Hold Steady wowed fans with an album play performance of “Separation Sunday” in front of a rapt crowd. Rilo Kiley, an indie band that hadn’t played Chicago since 2008, packed the Radical stage, where frontwoman Jenny Lewis delighted fans with her incredible vocals, intoxicating stage presence and songs that many fans hadn’t had a chance to hear in many years. Lewis has had a robust solo career, and visits the city often, but watching her rock out alongside singer and guitarist Blake Sennett, drummer Jason Boesel and bassist Pierre “Duke” de Reeder took many in the audience back to their college days, leading to crowdwide singalongs to “With Arms Outstretched” and “Portions for Foxes.” Local punk rock outfit Alkaline Trio also had an album play performance of 2000’s “Maybe I’ll Catch Fire” in front an enthused crowd of diehard fans of the trio that dates back to the ’90s heyday of Chicago punk rock. They kicked off with familiar hits like “Private Eye” and “Calling All Skeletons” before diving into the album, performing some cuts that hadn’t been seen on stage since 2015. But ultimately, it was “Weird Al”‘s day, and the pop-culture icon did not disappoint with this stop on his “Bigger and Weirder 2025” world tour. He offered a video plethora of his appearances in TV shows and movies from “Naked Gun” to “The Simpsons.” This montages gave him the opportunity to make multiple costume changes, donning a fat suit for “Fat,” scooting around on a hoverboard for “White & Nerdy” and impersonating Kurt Cobain for “Smells Like Nirvana.” The world’s most famous accordionist has so many songs that he had to offer many via medley format, although some, like “Amish Paradise,” got the full treatment, complete with backing choir. The huge crowd roared its approval, one of the biggest to ever pack the Rise stage area, making navigation through the crowd extremely difficult. Those who still had energy after that made their way to view headliners Blink-182 or The Pogues on the Riot or Rebel stages, respectively. But some took “Weird Al” as their closer and headed out of the fest to stumble home and get some rest ahead of the next day’s jam-packed lineup.

				Michael Liptrot","September 19, 2025","Austin, Garfield Park, North Lawndale",NA,"AUSTIN — Students leaving McNair Elementary School in Austin on Thursday walked by a memorial made of candles and balloons, marking the site where a driver hit and killed one of their classmates, 9-year-old Anakin Perez, that morning. Perez’s family and fellow McNair families are calling on Chicago Public Schools to add more crossing guards and staff outside the school — which has just one crossing guard — to prevent further tragedies. About 7:40 a.m. Thursday, Anakin was crossing the street in front of McNair Elementary, 4820 W. Walton St., when a woman driving westbound hit him, police and family said. Anakin was taken to Stroger Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The female driver was taken into custody and issued a citation for failure to exercise due care to a pedestrian in the road, police said. The driver has since been released from custody, and the investigation is ongoing, police said Friday. Anakin’s family gathered with neighbors to mourn the child at a vigil around school dismissal time Thursday. The fourth-grader was remembered as a friendly, athletic, lovable and very energetic child, said Yesenia Fernandez, Anakin’s aunt and a mother of a first- and fifth-grader at McNair. Community members at the vigil recalled Anakin as a joyful kid who loved coming to their homes to play. Classmates tearfully embraced as they remembered him. Parents picking up their children and community leaders said the death could have been prevented with adequate crossing guard and CPS Safe Passage staffing. “The family [of Anakin Perez] feels like more Safe Passage would be good for the community, and I can agree with them on that,” Ald. Emma Mitts (37th) said. “We always can use more Safe Passage workers out here, or crossing guards, something to help look out for the kids as they’re moving in the neighborhood. Every parent can’t be there to walk them home or take them to school. … You want to know that the child gets home safe and is going to school safe.” CPS’s Safe Passage program is offered at select schools, providing adults stationed along popular walking routes to schools to monitor students during arrival and dismissal. McNair is not included in the Safe Passage program, according to the program’s website. Parents, family and Mitts said McNair only has one crossing guard — far from the proper staffing for them to consider students safe. “This should have never happened to him because this is a child,” Fernandez said. “This would have been prevented if we had more security guards, crossing guards here to take care of the kids. This is something that should have been done before tragedy.” This summer, CPS laid off 161 employees, including many crossing guards, due to budget cuts, Chalkbeat Chicago reported. District leaders also said they would not fill 24 vacant crossing guard positions. Those cutbacks did not impact McNair, according to CPS. “We are devastated to confirm a student’s tragic death in front of their school,” a district spokesperson said in a statement. “Our hearts are heavy with grief for this child as well as concern and deep sympathy for his family and loved ones.” Parents said safety resources are badly needed near the school. “It’s a major problem. … We only have a crossing guard,” said Foentana Bobo, a McNair parent of a second-grader. “Why is [there] not a crossing guard right down Cicero and Augusta? They’re main streets that kids walk to school every day. … We definitely need to protect these kids.” Larra Mattix, a McNair parent of a first- and second-grader, said she has brought up her concerns over the lack of crossing guards to the school “on multiple occasions.” School staff directed her to Mitts’ office. Mattix has a meeting scheduled with Mitts’ office on the matter next week, she said. “Nothing has been done,”  Mattix said. “Most of the kids come from Cicero [Avenue] and most of them come from [Lamon Avenue], so they really need them on both ends.” The driver hit Anakin while he was crossing the street in front of the school, on Walton Street near Lamon Avenue, away from any intersection. The school’s only crossing guard, Lagina Scott, was one block north of the scene of the fatal collision, working at the intersection of Lamon Avenue and Augusta Boulevard. Scott said “most definitely” Perez’s death could have been prevented if a crossing guard or Safe Passage staff was at the closest intersection to the collision. A guard would have directed the 9-year-old to not cross the street outside of the marked intersections, she said. “You would’ve had somebody. That means I would have asked [Anakin] to cross right here and cross by me,” said Scott, who has worked as a crossing guard at McNair for three years. McNair’s principal, Benetrice Whitfield, wrote in a letter to the school community that grief counseling staff have been brought to the school to help students deal with the loss. “This tragic loss is sure to raise many emotions, concerns and questions for the entire school, especially our students,” Whitfield wrote. “We also encourage everyone to drive slowly and carefully while in the vicinity of the school, and please remind your child of the importance of being aware of their surroundings as they walk to and from school and around their neighborhood.” Support Local News!

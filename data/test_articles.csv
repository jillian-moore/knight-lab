				Reema Saleh",3 hours ago,Downtown,NA,"DOWNTOWN — For the past 98 years, swimming in the Chicago River was unthinkable. The once-contaminated river was a dumping ground for industrial pollution and sewage, creating toxic smells that kept would-be swimmers far away. But today, the Chicago River is cleaner than it was decades ago, and Sunday marked the first time an open-water swim has been held in the river since 1926. Organized by nonprofit A Long Swim, the event celebrated the city’s progress toward cleaning the river while raising money for ALS research and youth swim education programs. For Olivia Smoliga, a two-time Olympian from suburban Glenview, the opportunity was too historic to pass up. After finishing her one-mile race in first place, she felt ecstatic to be part of history. “I think it definitely will change the way that people see the river,” she said. “Truthfully, whenever we’d do a boat tour — hey, I’m ready to jump in it. I want to jump in, always, so the fact that I was able to do it and [Chicago) cleaned it up, it’s so nice.” Early Sunday, 500 open water swimmers dove into the river’s main stem, swimming from the Dearborn Street bridge to Wolf Point and back to the Clark Street bridge. Spectators watched the one- and two-mile swims from the Riverwalk. The day started off with some rain, which stopped before swimmers began to jump off the Riverwalk. Swimmers lined up in bathrobes and blue and red swim caps between the Dearborn and Clark streets bridges, with orange identification pouches attached to their sides. After applying to compete in the open swim, Wilmette resident Sarah Rainey loved getting to see the city from a completely different angle. “It’s a different type of architecture tour,” Rainey said. “I’m just excited to do it. It’s the first time in nearly a hundred years that anyone’s got to do it.” River swims used to be a feature of life in Chicago in the early 20th century, but official swim events in the river ended in 1926, according to A Long Swim. In 1900, the city reversed the flow of the river, sending sewage-riddled water away from Lake Michigan to protect its primary source of drinking water. In the years that followed, open water races popped up to celebrate, even though the clean river in those days was short-lived. “They would attract some of the top swimmers in the world, and thousands of spectators were in these old newspapers we found. But they were celebrating the fact that the river was so clean after its reversal,” said Doug McConnell, co-founder of A Long Swim. “We’re doing the same thing, celebrating that the river is so clean after all of the hard work that’s been done by the city, by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, and the nonprofits that are here.” The first river swim in nearly a century was supposed to take place last year, but A Long Swim’s event was moved to Lake Michigan after the city denied its permit for an event in the river. After this year’s successful event, A Long Swim plans to hold the event again in 2026. The 1972 Clean Water Act helped turn around the river’s fortunes, setting national goals to regulate pollution and stop illegal dumping. In the 1980s, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, Cook County’s sewage and stormwater agency, finished the first 31 miles of its Deep Tunnel system, taking sewage and stormwater to giant reservoirs where the water can be treated — and kept out of local riverways. In 2011, Chicago’s rivers met recreational water quality standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, finding that the river was swimmable, said Margaret Frisbie, executive director of Friends of the Chicago River. “We secured the standard, but there wasn’t all the other infrastructure in place to be like, okay, just jump in the water,” she said. “What we’ve been doing since then is trying to work to build awareness of swimming as a value for Chicago.” This September, Friends of the Chicago River was awarded the Thiess International River Prize by the International River Foundation for their work revitalizing the Chicago-Calumet River system. “I think what the swimming is going to demonstrate for people is that a new benchmark has been set,” Frisbie said. “There is a true cultural shift about to occur in how people view the river because people believe the things that they see and what they’re [seeing] is people swimming.” To prepare for the open swim, event organizers conducted multiple types of testing to ensure the water is safe before the event. Abhilasha Shrestha, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, led a team testing river water in the weeks leading up to the event. By pulling up bottles of water at different points in the river and taking them to a lab for testing, her lab measured how much fecal indicator bacteria are present in the water to determine if it’s safe to swim, like they’re also doing with the Chicago Park District at public beaches each day. Current, a nonprofit water innovation hub, is also doing real-time water quality testing on the river through sensors that detect tryptophan—an amino acid that’s presence often indicates fecal matter is in the water. Real-time water quality updates on the Chicago and Calumet Rivers are available on the H2ONow website, which is like a weather app but for swim safety. In the past several years, many Chicagoans have been embracing sites along the river as places for recreation and wildlife. Places like the Wild Mile, a floating ecopark near Goose Island run by nonprofit Urban Rivers, and Park 571 along Bubbly Creek have become popular public green spaces. While the river has become cleaner over time, its safety for swimming can fluctuate from day to day. Weather events, like storms and rainfall, can introduce contaminants from runoff water, carrying pollutants like bacteria, oil, and fertilizers into the river. When stormwater events overflow the city’s sewer system, it can find its way in the river, along with trash and litter. With the main stem of the river closer to Lake Michigan, the Riverwalk area is likely the cleanest portion. Stephen Meyer, volunteer coordinator with Urban Rivers, recalls how their volunteers who work on cleaning up the river will bring in trash from around the Wild Island and Bubbly Creek. After a double shift, “it’s normal for them to bring up well over a hundred pounds.” River safety can fluctuate, said Current’s founder, Alaina Harkness. “That’s the main message whenever anyone asks me how the river is doing. Over time? Much better. But over any given season, it’s variable,” she said. “It’s a living, moving thing that reflects the conditions around us, and it’s a receptacle for a lot of what we’re doing out here on the streets and roads.” The Chicago River is often fighting its past stigma of pollution and decay. But many swimmers said Sunday you wouldn’t have thought the body of water at one point had such a stigma. “Honestly, it’s about the same,” swimmer Sam Darrigrand, from Michigan, said of swimming in the river versus Lake Michigan. “The lake has better clarity, so you can’t see underwater. But other than that, it’s about the same.” Growing up in Chicago, Rebecca Mann always wanted to swim in the river, so she jumped at the first chance she got. She finished first in her two-mile race, excited to compete against other racers and raise money for ALS research. “Open water swimming is my passion, and the fact that I can do my passion to help other people and make the world a better place makes me really happy,” she said. After losing his father to ALS and after his sister was diagnosed, McConnell felt like he had to do something. Taking his lifelong passion for swimming and inspiration from fundraising open swims in other cities, A Long Swim became a way to raise money for scientific research while celebrating the clean river today. The event’s proceeds will go toward ALS research at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as to youth swim safety education programs. It raised approximately $150,000 for ALS research and $50,000 to support 2,000 youth swimmers at the Kroc Center, run by the Salvation Army in Chicago. “We’ve been stuck in that perception that the water is so unhealthy and it’s toxic. When people refer to it as an industrial waterway. There’s nothing like having hundreds of swimmers in there to show that’s not what it is anymore,” he added. Chicago’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Angela Tovar, hopes that the event will change people’s minds on the river from once-polluted waterway to a recreation space they can celebrate across its three branches. “The river definitely gets a bad rap … We can move away from that reputation of the river as just a toxic dump and really think about how far we’ve come, not just here Downtown, but across our neighborhoods, too,” she said.

https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/20/10-protesters-released-after-facing-shocking-violence-arrest-by-federal-agents-in-broadview/,"10 Protesters Released After Facing ‘Shocking Violence,’ Arrest By Federal Agents In Broadview","by
				Charles Thrush","September 20, 2025",Citywide,NA,"BROADVIEW – At least nine people were arrested amid a daylong standoff Friday at an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview that saw federal immigration officers bombard demonstrators with tear gas, flash bang grenades and pepper spray bullets. ICE reported that nine people were arrested Friday at the protest for “throwing bottles, fireworks and rocks at law enforcement,” a spokesperson for ICE said in a statement to Block Club. RELATED: Agents Tear Gas, Detain Demonstrators Outside Broadview ICE Facility During Friday Protest Block Club reporters and photographers on the scene did witness one firework and bottles thrown at officers by a small number of demonstrators after agents tear gassed and shot pepper balls at the crowd, including members of the media holding only cameras and notebooks. The People’s Law Office, a civil rights firm representing protesters, reported 10 people arrested at the protest. The discrepancy in arrest numbers could be attributed to one of the detained protesters being released from a separate location for an unknown reason, a spokesperson for the firm said. Both ICE and the People’s Law Office confirmed that all detained individuals from the Friday clashes had been released. All of those arrested received a court summons, a spokesperson for ICE said. The first sizable crowds assembled early Friday outside of the barricaded ICE facility and attempted to block unmarked ICE vehicles from entering and exiting the center’s gated parking lot. Federal officers drove through the crowd, shot non-lethal projectiles, threw flash bang grenades, pepper-sprayed and deployed tear gas at protesters they said were obstructing the path of the vehicles. Protesters had gathered in protest of President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz and Operation At Large campaigns in the Chicago area. Agents repeatedly attacked demonstrators, including Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh. Abughazaleh was thrown to the ground by an officer, video from the scene shows. “This is what it looks like when ICE violates our First Amendment rights,” she said in the post. Abughazaleh said the violence protesters experienced pales in comparison to what those detained in the facility experience. “I’m really glad that attention seems to be increasing,” Abughazaleh said. “It’s more important than ever for people with any sort of privilege or any sort of platform to be doing everything they can to stand for what’s right, because fascism does not come for the people in power at first. It comes for the people that don’t have eyes on them. It comes for 238 men who are deported without due process to another country. It comes for the pregnant women and grandmothers sleeping on the floor in Broadview.” This is what it looks like when ICE violates our First Amendment rights. pic.twitter.com/EneI3BAkPF An agent also unholstered his gun while he stood near unarmed protesters, and protesters said they were pepper sprayed for no reason several times throughout the day. By early afternoon, ICE said it had arrested three demonstrators that it accused of blocking the entrance to the Broadview building and assaulting agents, according to CBS2. Later Friday, a fourth person was seen being taken into custody after a shoving match with an agent in which she at one point was pushed to the ground. That agent had to be held back on multiple occasions by his peers as he made movements toward other protesters who continued cursing at him. About 15 minutes after the woman’s arrest, an ambulance arrived at the facility and took her to a nearby hospital. It wasn’t clear whether she remained in custody. “We were assaulted by ICE officers,” said A’Keisha, a protester leading chants with a megaphone. “They pushed people to the ground and shot us with pepper spray balls while we have remained peaceful.” Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who stood in the crowd with protesters and is also running for Rep. Jan Schakowsky’s vacant seat in Illinois’ 9th congressional district alongside Abughazaleh, was horrified by the scene. “I’ve seen shocking violence,” Biss said. “I mean, throwing people to the ground, pepper balls, tear gas. … It seems gratuitous, right? They’re trying to intimidate. They’ve got guys up there on the roof with cameras. “They’re trying to remind people that this is an administration that names and then targets its political enemies for physical and economic violence.” Another woman confronted federal officers and was pepper-sprayed before being thrown to the ground and choked out, depicted in a video released to social media Friday. She was seen holding up a peace sign after the incident. Agents clad head-to-toe in military gear — some carrying large guns — tossed cans of tear gas into the crowd while an officer on the roof of the building fired off pepper balls. Another agent with a camera could be seen on the roof. Chicagoans have reported more sightings of federal immigration agents and more people being detained. In response, more people have been showing up at protests outside the Broadview detention center, hoping to help immigrant neighbors and raise awareness about what’s happening. The Sun-Times spoke to the daughters of one detainee who said he was held in a cell with 150 other men, had his medication taken away and was not given regular food. A Honduran woman detained in June told the paper she was in a room with 30 women, with little food and no bed or bedding. The Associated Press reported Friday that immigration enforcement officials had arrested almost 550 people as part of its Chicago-area operations. Gregory Bovino, a chief patrol agent for Border Patrol who led a similar enforcement campaign in Los Angeles, showed up at the facility Friday afternoon. The protest swelled to about 150 demonstrators and tensions raised again by Friday evening, with at least two people seen being arrested and agents again firing pepper balls at the crowd. Matthew Perchess of Niles stripped off his second shirt of the day, which was soaked with a mixture of water and pepper spray. A red, quarter-sized welt on his lower left abdomen matched the red heart tattooed on his chest. “They shot me three times in the back,” said Perchess, who pointed out that the agents’ pepper balls had left a deep mark on him, despite the heavy vest he wore to protect himself. About 20 officers marched toward the protesters, a cloud of smoke obscuring them. They threw a flash bang grenade at the crowd while agents on the roof fired pepper balls. One demonstrator volleyed a flash bang back at the officers while red fireworks ignited in the middle of the street. Jovany Parra, of Chicago, had a tear gas canister burst beneath his feet late Friday. He said he saw the canister launch at him and then separate into three pieces before a peppery explosion choked him. “I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t see,” said Parra, whose friend, KP, had aided him as he recovered. “It’s definitely the worst I’ve experienced at a protest,” KP added. The two friends, both first-generation Mexican Americans, were motivated to attend the protest after ICE killed Villegas Gonzalez in Franklin Park last week. “Because he looks like us,” KP said.

				Molly DeVore","September 19, 2025","Jefferson Park, Portage Park, Norwood Park",NA,"NORWOOD PARK — A viral social media video this week claimed that employees at a Norwood Park Starbucks wrote “Loser” on a drink ordered in honor of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. An online furor followed, and the coffee shop even closed temporarily. But Starbucks now says that time-stamped footage from the store at 6332 N. Northwest Highway does not show any of its workers writing that message. Instead, the note appears “to have been added after the beverage was handed off, likely by someone else,” a spokesperson told Block Club. The controversy started with a post Tuesday from Jacqueline Garretson, who, according to her X bio, is the Illinois state director for The Conservative Caucus and previously worked as a staffer for failed Republican attorney general candidate Thomas DeVore. Garretson wrote that a relative, whom she later identified as her mother-in-law, ordered the Mint Majesty tea with two honeys — an order known to be Kirk’s favorite drink — from the Starbucks. When the order was completed, the cup had “Loser” written on it, Garretson said. Garretson encouraged followers to call Starbucks and report the incident. She later posted two videos of her and an unidentified man confronting workers at the Norwood Park Starbucks. “I’m talking 5 p.m. today, I want some form of action to the employee that represents this business that wrote ‘Loser’ on my mother’s cup,” the man, who is not seen on-camera, can be heard saying in the video, which was posted Wednesday. “We’re looking for not corporate bureaucracy. I want immediate accountability; and if not, I will have this whole intersection lined with patriots today, I’m not even joking,” the man told a Starbucks employee. The videos received more than 40,000 likes on X. On Wednesday evening, Garretson posted that she went back to the Norwood Park Starbucks at 5 p.m. and found a sign that said the business was temporarily closed. “Thank you to everybody that called, stopped in to order Charlie’s drink and put in complaints with corporate. Over the past 24 hours we have SHUT THEM DOWN,” Garretson wrote in text over the video. In an email to Block Club, a Starbucks spokesperson confirmed the Norwood Park location was closed for “a portion of the day” Wednesday. However, the spokesperson said the company reviewed timestamped in-store video footage and found the note was not written by a Starbucks employee. The note appears “to have been added after the beverage was handed off, likely by someone else,” the spokesperson said. The Norwood Park Starbucks was back open Thursday, the spokesperson said. Garretson did not respond to a request for comment. In one of the videos, Garretson can be heard saying she “knew Charlie personally.” Kirk, who was raised in suburban Arlington Heights and was the founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot last last week during a speaking appearance at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. After his death, a video of Kirk describing his go-to Starbucks order as a Mint Majesty tea with two honeys resurfaced. In a separate viral video, a Starbucks employee in Yucaipa, California, reportedly refused to write Kirk’s name on a Mint Majesty order, saying “we can’t do political names.” Starbucks, in a statement Wednesday, addressed both incidents. “We aim to be a community coffeehouse where everyone feels welcome, so we have previously provided guidance to our partners to respectfully ask the customer to use a different name when attempting to use political slogans or phrases in place of their name. We are clarifying with our team now that names, on their own, can be used by customers on their café order, as they wish,” the statement said. Support Local News!

				Leen Yassine",6 hours ago,Arts & Culture,NA,"DOUGLASS PARK — It was all about John Stamos on day two of Riot Fest Saturday, as the “Full House” star made his triumphant debut at the festival after years of online ribbing from its organizers. Festival organizers had acquiesced to a list of Stamos’ nine demands before he would appear at the fest this year, including: organizer “Riot Mike” Petryshyn getting a tattoo in his honor, the creation of a Chicago Greek-style pizza and a John Stamos lookalike contest, which drew hoards of fans on Saturday afternoon around the famed Stamos butter statue. Among 15 competitors, Wicker Park resident Chris Maimonis was crowned the winner. He told Block Club it felt “like a dream come true.” “People have been telling me I look like Stamos since I was a little kid, and then as soon as they made this contest, everybody I know started texting me, telling me I gotta get in it,” he said. “I literally bought the ticket today just because of this.” While Maimonis had never been to Riot Fest before, he was looking forward to the rest of the day, especially seeing Jack White’s set. “It’s gonna be fun walking around today, I’ll tell you that,” he said. “I’m just on top of the world right now.” Based on cheers, the seeming runner-up was Lincoln Park resident Griffin Snead. “I’m gonna call myself that, that’s for sure,” Snead said of being runner-up. Donning a black jeans, a green button up shirt and oversized leather jacket, Snead said he dressed the part, channeling the style of Uncle Jesse, Stamos’ “Full House” character. He found out about the contest through X, formerly Twitter, and radio announcements, he said. Though Snead’s been to Riot Fest three times so far, he showed up Saturday specifically for the contest. “It was a blast. It was a great way to meet a bunch of people with incredible hair,” he said. “That’s what its really all about, is celebrating incredible hair and Greek heritage.” And finally, after a 12-year pursuit involving online harassment, Stamos himself appeared at the alternative rock fest. At 6:20 p.m. Saturday, despite light rainfall and storm threats, Stamos took to the Riot Stage alongside The Beach Boys. He stepped out playing guitar and donning an on-brand black leather jacket and shades. “How about it, after all these years, John Stamos is here?” singer Mike Love asked the crowd. Stamos first played with The Beach Boys about 40 years ago, and one of his first big shows was a 4th of July concert at the Washington Monument in 1985, according to the Ravinia Backstage Blog. The actor has famously a fan of the band and has wanted to share their music with younger generations. Stamos said the first song he sang with the band was “Barbara Ann,” per the blog — which they played Saturday night. Other favorites performed by The Beach Boys included “Forever,” which was featured in “Full House.” Clips of the classic sitcom played in the background as they performed. Eventually, Stamos took off his leather jacket to reveal a special Riot Fest T-shirt, and also swapped out his guitar for the drums. He praised the fest for “ribbing me all these years.” “You’ve kept me humble,” he said. GWAR, known for their intense constumaery and over-the-top theatrics, also attracted a ginormous crowd Saturday afternoon on the Rebel Stage, splattering them with fake blood, which could be spied on attendees long after their set. The band decapitated a character who looked a lot like Elon Musk — complete in a DOGE shirt — and destroyed a facsimile of President Donald Trump as the crowd roared its approval. Local acts were also among Saturday’s highlights. Feral Tact — a two-piece featuring Mikey Ramsay on vocals and teenager Max McQuaid on drums, born from a chance meeting tied to Chicago punk veterans Sludgeworth — rocked the Rebel Stage at 12:40 p.m., drawing a sizable crowd despite an early set time and rain. Playing Riot Fest is a fantasy come true after watching it from the wings in 2023, they told Block Club. The audience was filled with new and old fans alike, including Alyssa Duff and Kaitlyn Hackett, cousins of the lead singer. “They were playing just little small shows with family, and then different bars around Chicago [like] Cobra Lounge,” said Duff, who lives in Humboldt Park. “Then we found out they were playing here, so of course we had to get tickets and come support. And it was really good.” Seeing their growth is “crazy,” Hackett said. “It was amazing, and the mosh pit really set the vibe for the whole thing,” said Hackett, who lives in Logan Square. “We didn’t know any of the people who started that mosh pit so it wasn’t family, but they all seemed to really be enjoying it. It was really fun, and they had a good turnout.” Knuckle Puck, a five-piece rock band that formed in the suburbs in 2010, were on the Rise Stage at 5:20 p.m. They played a 60-minute set to a big crowd and celebrated 10 years since the release of their album, “Copacetic.” At 7:25 p.m., flocks of festgoers gathered at the Roots Stage for Jack White, guitarist and lead singer of defunct rock duo the White Stripes. He played hits like “Seven Nation Army,” “Icky Thump” and “Steady, As She Goes” while shredding on the guitar and drums. Headlining band Weezer closed out the night shortly after on the Riot Stage, playing a 90-minute, solar exploration-themed set. Band members donned astronaut outfits and referred to their albums as planets while celestial graphics set the backdrop. Ahead of playing their full-length debut album, “The Blue Album,” which marked its 30th anniversary last year, they featured hits like “Island in the Sun,” “Hash Pipe” and fan-favorite “Pork and Beans.” While performing “Beverly Hills,” they swapped out the lyrics to say, “Chicago, Illinois, that’s where I want to be” — which was met with cheers of approval from the crowd.

				Charles Thrush",3 hours ago,"Jefferson Park, Portage Park, Norwood Park",NA,"JEFFERSON PARK – A family of six has been displaced after a CTA bus slammed into their Jefferson Park home Saturday night while the family was watching TV. Now, the family is seeking temporary shelter after the crash wrecked much of their house. The bus was driving northbound in the 5500 block of North Central Avenue around 10:40 p.m. Saturday when a black sedan crashed into the driver’s side of the bus after the car drove through a stop sign on West Catalpa Avenue, police said. The bus driver lost control after the initial impact, first hitting a parked car, then barreling through a fence before finally crashing into and destroying the house, police said. The 46-year-old bus driver suffered a laceration to her head and was taken to a local hospital in fair condition, police said. No one else was on the bus and no other injuries were reported. The driver of the car that caused the crash fled the scene and no arrests have been made. The family was sitting in their living room watching television when the bus crashed into the house, said Art Huet, who owns the property. “We heard a big bang while we were just watching TV,” he recounted. “I thought we were dead.” A large crack in the side of the house was visible Sunday morning behind police tape. The front steps were split and debris was scattered throughout the front yard. Photos from a GoFundMe started for the family shows the interior of the home with cracked walls and a failing ceiling. The building was ordered off-limits by the city, according to a sticker on its front facade. The adjacent building’s backyard had also been destroyed in the crash and further down the road a grey Honda SUV could be seen with severe damage to the rear of the car. The GoFundMe, posted by Cristy Flores, for her sister’s family of six that was displaced in the crash. “This family of six, with 4 kids, is grateful that no one was hurt, but they urgently need temporary housing since their house is no longer livable and they’re facing the added obstacle of being unable to retrieve their belongings due to safety concerns,” the fundraiser reads. Nearly $2,000 dollars of the $6,000 goal has been raised for the family as of Sunday afternoon. “With unwavering faith and the power of community support, they’ll overcome this challenge,” the fundraiser reads.

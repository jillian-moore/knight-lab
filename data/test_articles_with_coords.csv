https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/09/28/ice-escalates-violence-against-protesters-in-broadview-journalist-arrested/,"ICE Escalates Violence Against Protesters In Broadview, Journalist Arrested","by
				Charles Thrush",6 hours ago,Citywide,BROADVIEW,NA,"BROADVIEW — A day after the mayor of suburban Broadview sounded the alarm about ICE officials “making war” in her community, federal authorities appeared to double down Saturday, arresting at least one journalist and using chemical weapons on protesters and members of the press. In a Friday letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson asked that the agency stop “deploying chemical arms, such as tear gas, pepper spray, etc. against American citizens, our residents, and our first responders,” at the ICE processing facility, 1903 Beach St. in Broadview. After the letter was covered by the media, Broadview police were warned by ICE of increased enforcement action Saturday, which they believe is an act of retaliation by Homeland Security for speaking out. “In retaliation for the Village of Broadview yesterday calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to ‘stop making war on our community,’ ICE agents this morning informed the Broadview Police Department that there will be ‘a s*** show’ in Broadview today,” a press release from the village said. The Sun-Times reports that agents fired pepper balls into a group of about 75 protesters Saturday evening and made several arrests. Steve Held, a journalist with investigative upstart Unraveled Press, was among those arrested Saturday, according to Unraveled and other journalists on the scene. Unraveled said on social media early Sunday that Held was “safe” and among those released by federal authorities overnight. Raven Geary, Held’s colleague at Unraveled, was shot in the face with a pepper ball by federal officers on Friday and sought medical attention afterwards, Block Club reporters witnessed. “We have never witnessed anything like what ICE has unleashed on our communities this week,” Unraveled said in a statement posted to social media Sunday. Eleven people were arrested outside the ICE facility Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement posted to the platform X, previously known as Twitter. In a joint statement ahead of Saturday’s planned protest, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, State Sen. Robert Peters and Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) urged civilians to stay away from further protests near the facility — fearing that ICE will be willing to use lethal force on peaceful protesters. “ICE has escalated their use of tear gas, pepper rounds, and rubber bullets, shooting protesters and members of the press in the face without provocation on numerous occasions,” the letter states. “ICE agents at Broadview have also unholstered their guns repeatedly, pointing machine and hand guns directly at protesters. ICE is willing to use lethal force, as we’ve seen in the recent killing of Silverio Villegas Gonzalez in Franklin Park.” Federal officers representing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were seen assisting Homeland Security agents outside the Broadview facility Saturday. Tensions have been escalating outside of the processing facility in the western suburb since Sept. 19, when federal officers began shooting pepper spray balls, deploying tear gas and throwing flash bang grenades at protesters attempting to block federal vehicles from entering and exiting the premises. Friday’s protest saw federal officers unleash more violence on protesters, including a sniper who shot baton rounds into a crowd of hundreds packed into a parking lot adjacent to the facility. Saturday’s action comes as President Donald Trump announced a deployment of federal troops to ICE facilities in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere – authorizing “full force” on protesters he described as extremists. In a statement Saturday, Gov.  J.B. Pritzker said he is “monitoring the federal deployments” and in close contact with Broadview police. “I urge members of the public to remain calm, stay safe, and document what you see with your phones and cameras,” Pritzker said. My senior team has also asked legal organizations to support monitoring on the ground. By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.” Support Local News!

				Michael Liptrot",2 hours ago,"Austin, Garfield Park, North Lawndale",AUSTIN,NA,"AUSTIN — Vernelia Harris and Janis Fuller are friends who met through Austin’s Harambee Community Garden. And while they enjoy their access to the area’s public gardens, they have less opportunities to get fresh fruits and vegetables in Austin, they said. “We just have the 7-Eleven type of stores, they don’t have the range and produce that you get in a normal store,” said Fuller, a 20-year resident of the Austin area. “You’re buying a lot of stuff we shouldn’t be eating, especially for our community. It’s a lot of junk food with chemicals and coloring and has high salt, too much fat.” Access to fresh food and groceries has gotten a boost in the neighborhood with the opening of Forty Acres Fresh Market, the Black woman-owned store which held a ribbon cutting Saturday at 5713 W. Chicago Ave. Harris and Fuller visited the long-in-the-works grocery store Saturday. Previously, their best local options for fresh produce were through the farmers market or occasional food giveaways, the friends said. “Although I’m 90-years-old, I can walk over here to this store,” said Harris, displaying the green tomatoes she had just bought from Forty Acres Fresh Market. “I’m just so excited about this store, something that we truly need on the West Side.” Forty Acres Fresh Market is an expansion of owner Elizabeth “Liz” Abunaw’s grocery delivery service established in 2017. Eight years later, Abunaw said seeing her dream fulfilled is only the first step is reshaping the narrative around access to fresh food in Austin. “We don’t undo years of systemic disinvestment,” Abunaw said. “Now that there are four grocery stores to serve 97,000 people across seven and a half square miles, this is a beginning … a hopeful catalyst.” The store includes an extensive inventory of fresh produce, frozen food, a hot bar, a butcher shop, hygiene products and common household supplies. Many of these products have not been readily accessible to Austin and greater West Side residents, as the area has been without access to grocery stores and other retail businesses that are readily available in other neighborhoods. The 2020 closure of Austin’s Save A Lot at 5555 W. North Ave. left many residents without access to fresh fruits and vegetables or healthy eating options. The following year, the Aldi store in West Garfield Park abruptly closed — and is now set to become an affordable housing complex. Many were forced to travel long distances for groceries in the wake of the closures. The announcement of Forty Acres Fresh Market securing a brick-and-mortar location was viewed as filling the void left by absent grocers. It builds on earlier successes in addressing food access. Last year, Austin Harvest opened a permanent location in the neighborhood. At Saturday’s opening, Abunaw said the issue of so-called food deserts on the West Side is greater than simply disinvestment in a neighborhood, but rather a issue systemic discrimination issue that some have coined “food apartheid.” “I prefer the term ‘food apartheid’ because it is absolutely separate, unequal and breaks down along racial lines … it’s not accidental,” Abunaw said. Several community members and leaders spoke about the significance of having a grocery store that is easily accessible. “I don’t walk as much as I used to, but I can walk to the grocery store because I live right down the street,” U.S. Rep. Danny Davis said at the ribbon cutting ceremony. Abunaw established Forty Acres in 2017 and held her first pop-up in January 2018. She previously told Block Club the name is a reference to the unfulfilled promise to offer 40 acres and a mule as reparations to Black people after 200 years of slavery. Forty Acres partnered with Westside Health Authority to secure the space for a permanent grocery store in 2020 with funding from the Christopher Family Foundation, the Lumpkin Family Foundation and a state minority-owned business grant. Abunaw then received a $2.5 million grant from the Chicago Recovery Fund in 2022 to support the buildout. Construction began following a November 2023 groundbreaking. Earlier this month, Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th) announced plans to support partially lifting a moratorium on liquor licenses in the area for a year to allow the grocery store to sell alcohol. A PNC bank branch is also open at 5717 W. Chicago Ave., sharing a building with Forty Acres. The branch features two ATMs and workstations. This is the first branch PNC has built since opening their Hyde Park location in 2018. Support Local News! Subscribe to Block Club Chicago, an independent, 501(c)(3), journalist-run newsroom.

				Charles Thrush",4 hours ago,"Uptown, Edgewater, Rogers Park",UPTOWN,NA,"UPTOWN — A teenager was killed and a woman was wounded in a Friday night shooting, the second teen slain in Uptown in less than two weeks, according to police. Around 11:50 p.m. Friday, officers responded to a call of shots fired in the 1200 block of West Sunnyside Avenue and discovered an unconscious 18-year-old man with a gunshot wound to his head, police said. He was taken to Illinois Masonic Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Officers also found a 27-year-old woman who was shot in her right arm, and she was taken to the same hospital in good condition, police said. Four guns were discovered at the scene by officers, according to police. No one is in custody. The shooting came less than two weeks after the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old boy in the Asia on Argyle section of Uptown. The teenager was standing outside in the 5000 block of North Winthrop Avenue around 12:20 a.m. Sept. 15 when a group of eight men approached him, police said. One of the men pulled out a gun and shot the teenager, killing him. He was pronounced dead at Illinois Masonic Hospital, police said. The 17-year-old was identified as Khalif Norwood by his mother, ABC 7 reported. Norwood’s mother alleged that the boy was in the neighborhood visiting friends when he was killed. Detectives are investigating the incident and no one is yet in custody. Ald. Angela Clay (26th) condemned the violence  in a statement posted to social media and said she is working with authorities to address the shootings. “No one should live in fear of violence. I’m working with CPD to support our community during this difficult time. Please keep the victims in your thoughts as we stand united against violence,” the statement read. Support Local News!

				Francia Garcia Hernandez","September 26, 2025","Pilsen, Little Village, Back of the Yards",This is part our series of daily recaps of ICE activity in the Chicago region,NA,"This is part our series of daily recaps of ICE activity in the Chicago region. Have a tip we should check out? Email newsroom@blockclubchi.org. BACK OF THE YARDS — Neighbors lined up Friday morning at a stand in Back of the Yards, looking to get food from the well-known Laura’s Tamales stand. But this time, the familiar face of Laura Murillo, a mother of three, was not there to greet them. Instead, neighbors and organizers had taken over the stand near West 47th Street and South Western Avenue, raising funds to support Murillo after immigration agents arrested her Thursday morning. “This is what it’s going to take – people coming together,” said Berto Aguayo, founder of local nonprofit Increase the Peace. Aguayo, a native of Back of the Yards, and other organizers bought out Friday’s tamales stock and “took over her shift” to raise funds for Murillo’s family. Aguayo said he wants to inspire those who can – U.S. citizens, young people, organizers and attorneys – to support their neighbors as federal agents target undocumented people with immigration operations Midway Blitz and At Large. Federal agents have detained more than 500 people in and around Chicago since the operations began this month, according to CNN. Murillo was one of several people whom agents arrested Thursday near a Home Depot on the Southwest Side. In a nearby shopping center, more than half a dozen vehicles, including a Customs and Border Patrol truck, were seen “caravanning” in what organizers called a “show of force” meant to intimidate the majority Latino area. Agents’ presence Thursday prompted organizers to urge neighbors to stay home. On Friday, one of Murillo’s daughters, who Block Club is not identifying for her safety, stood at the stand where her mother worked every day for about 10 years. She was shaken about her mother’s detention but happy to see the display of solidarity and the “power of community,” she said. “I’m proud of my mom. She wouldn’t believe all the support she’s getting,” she said with tears in her eyes. “She doesn’t know because I haven’t told her, but I look forward to telling her when I can.” A few minutes later, Murillo’s daughter got a call from a number that appeared to be from an immigration detention facility. But the call couldn’t continue as Murillo’s family had not been able to set up a payment card for calls because Murillo does not have an A-number, said Jaime Perez, Murillo’s fiancé. An A-number is an identification number assigned to noncitizens by immigration authorities. On Thursday, Perez and Murillo’s daughter briefly spoke to Murillo over the phone. They haven’t been able to talk to her since, Perez said. It appears she is being held at the processing center in suburban Broadview, and the family is in the process of hiring an attorney, Perez said. “It was a really brief conversation. She said, ‘I love you. Take care of your sister,'” Murillo’s daughter said. Originally from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Murillo is a single mother of three and the “hardest-working woman you could ever meet,” Perez said. His biggest hope is she gets released, he said. Murillo is the sole caretaker of a teenage daughter with special needs and a college-age daughter, both U.S. citizens. For about 20 years, Murillo has woken up at 1 a.m. to prepare tamales, distribute them at other stands she owns and head to her stand, where she would sell the famous Mexican food until 11 a.m., her daughter said. Though her family was afraid of her getting detained, she had decided to keep working to provide for them, her eldest daughter told ABC7. “She’s a really happy lady. She likes to make everyone happy,” her daughter said. “That’s what she liked the most: helping others.” As the sun rose Friday and some of Murillo’s regular customers arrived, they were shocked to hear of her detention. Some embraced her daughter, while others asked how they could help the family. Some people even stopped their cars to donate money or honked in support as they drove by. “It’s a heartbreaking thing, families getting torn apart. We’re here to support,” said a neighbor who declined to share her name. She arrived early Friday to buy tamales after seeing a post about the fundraiser on social media, she said. Jesse Iñiguez, owner of Back of the Yards Coffee, arrived with a few gallons of the shop’s signature café de olla — a show of solidarity for the “neighborhood, the family” he calls home, he said. “This isn’t about criminals; it’s about going after the Latino and immigrant communities,” he said. “But this motivates me. When we are attacked, how do we respond? With community.” Standing near the Southwest Side Home Depot where several people have been detained, attorneys Krystal Robledo and Enrique Espinoza said neighbors can support each other by recording immigration authorities’ operations, being visible and helping others stay informed. “People need to remember they have rights,” Espinoza said. About 7:30 a.m. Friday, organizers announced they had sold out over 300 tamales, embracing each other and chanting “Si se pudo” on behalf of Murillo. “Buy out a local vendor stand, take over their shifts, join a migra watch,” Aguayo said. • Organizers have had to postpone the Community Workforce & Resource Fair that was scheduled for Saturday at Kelly College Prep due to concerns about increased ICE activity in the area, the Brighton Park Neighborhood Network announced. • Border patrol agents took pictures on the Chicago River with Trump Tower in the background — even though the Chicago River does not touch any foreign borders. Downtown Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd) called it a “photo op.” • At 7:20 a.m., an ICE vehicle was seen near St. Louis and Wrightwood avenues, according to the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team. • At 11:25 a.m. Friday, agents detained two people near North and Humphrey avenues, according to the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team. • At 11:30 a.m. Friday, federal agents in tactical gear were seen near 51st Street and Seeley Avenue, according to the Southwest Rapid Response Team. • Federal agents tear gassed and shot rubber bullets at protesters Friday outside the Broadview ICE facility. Another protest is planned for 6 p.m. Saturday outside the facility. • At noon Sunday, the Berwyn-Cicero Care Web will pass out Know Your Rights information, whistles and other resources to neighbors at the Clyde Park District Cicero Sports Complex, 1808 S. Laramie Ave. in Cicero. You can follow these organizations for updates about immigration enforcement activity. Support Local News!

NEIGHBORHOOD MAPPING METHODOLOGY
=================================

This analysis maps Block Club Chicago articles to Chicago's 77 official 
community areas using a hierarchical matching system:

1. PRIMARY MATCHING (Sub-community field):
   - Extract the lead text before em-dash/hyphen in article content
   - Match against neighborhood mapping table
   - If match found, use ONLY this neighborhood

2. SECONDARY MATCHING (Article Sections):
   - If no primary match, parse parsely.meta.articleSection field
   - Check each section against mapping table
   - Collect ALL matching neighborhoods

3. TERTIARY MATCHING (Primary Category):
   - If still no match, parse slp_primary_category.name field
   - Check each category against mapping table
   - Collect ALL matching neighborhoods

4. DEFAULT ASSIGNMENT:
   - If no matches found, assign to 'chicago' (citywide)
